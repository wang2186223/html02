###Chapter 1 Her Husband Took His First Love To A Hotel
Hannah Scott bitterly learned that her husband,Vincent Jones, hooked up with his first love-the twNO of them checked into a hotel together. She watched it all unfold, unable to look away. His first love bore an uncanny resemblance to her.

From about ten meters away, Hannah pulled out her phone and called Vincent. "Didn't your grandmother suggest we take the health examination since we're trying for a baby? Are you free right now?"
"I'm busy with a business dinner. Not tonight-maybe next time," Vincent answered.
"Alright," Hannah replied, keeping her voice even before she hung up. Unbelievable. There he was,about to entertain another woman in a hotel room,and he still had the nerve to mention "next time."
Hannah trailed behind them and stopped at their hotel room door. Laughter and flirtatious voices spilled out once they were inside. For a moment, she considered barging in and confronting them on the spot. But she held back. Her fury faded quickly,replaced by a deep and lasting disappointment. That was when she knew it was time to let go.

Hannah wasted no time contacting a lawyer to draft a divorce agreement. Barely after she signed her name, Danica Jones, Vincent's mother, asked to meet.

The two women met at a small café and settled in across from each other.

"You probably haven't heard, but Brinley is back,"Danica said condescendingly.

Brinley Gilbert. She was Vincent's first love, and Danica had always adored her.
Danica leaned in, her tone casual, almost delighted."Name your price. How much does it take for you to walk away from Vincent?"
Danica had never approved of Hannah, largely due to
her unremarkable background. She sought to pair her son with a wealthy socialite who could help expand the Jones Group.
Hannah kept her voice steady. "Transfer every property under your name to me, and I'll give your beloved son his freedom."
Danica had a special love for luxury real estate. She owned several high-end properties with a total worth exceeding billions.
"You're serious?" Danica looked genuinely surprised by how quickly Hannah agreed. For five whole years,Hannah had lived as Vincent's secret wife, giving up her own career, never seeking attention, and taking on the role of the perfect housewife behind closed doors.Most people assumed she was desperately in love with Vincent.
"Yeah. I've had enough. I'm finished here. I just want out," Hannah remarked. As Brinley's face flashed through her thoughts, a deep coldness settled over her. She realized Vincent had never loved her. He  married her only because she looked like his first love.


It all made sense now. No wonder he would never say "I love you" no matter how many times she asked.Though her chest tightened, she refused to shed a single tear. He was just a man, nothing special. Like garbage-meant to be tossed aside.


Danica's lips curled into a satisfied smile. In her eyes,Hannah was never good enough for her son-her background too ordinary and her manners frivolous."You've finally become somewhat sensible. But there's one more condition. You can't breathe a word about this secret marriage, and Vincent must never find out about our deal."



"Agreed." Hannah's smile turned cold. "Once the divorce goes through, all ten of your properties are mine."



"Five properties. We're still family now. You could at least offer me that," Danica suggested.


"Absolutely not," HHannah said as she rose from her seat. "Unless you'd rather I stay on as Vincent's wife -and we both know that role is worth far more than ten properties."
Danica's face tightened. Her answer came through gritted teeth. "Fine."
After leaving the café, Hannah stopped in front of a fountain and lingered for several minutes, her mind in turmoil. Then, finally, she made up her mind. She slid her wedding ring off her finger, tossed it into the fountain, and walked away without glancing back.
For the first time, she stepped into a private club,ordered a round of drinks, and hired a few male escorts to keep her company-every one of them charming, well-built, and perfectly put together.She could touch whoever caught her eye. Any one of these smooth-talking and good-looking escorts was far better than the cold, distant husband she was leaving behind.
Her presence didn't go unnoticed. Bobby Howard, a longtime friend of Vincent's, caught sight of her across the crowded club. He remembered her always   bright  trailing after Vincent, never once claiming even the title of girlfriend.


Watching her laughing and flirting with those dashing male escorts, Bobby pulled out his phone and called Vincent.



"You need anything?" Vincent's tone was as cold as ever.


"You and your little tagalong have a fight?"


Vincent didn't respond.


"I just saw her at the club," Bobby added. "She went into a private room with a handful of male escorts."


Vincent's tone was clipped. "Text me the address.And the room number."
###Chapter 2 Tricked Him Into SigningThe Divorce Agreement
 

Hannah lounged in the private room, drinking one colorful cocktail after another. Every glass tasted sweet and packed a punch, and soon a pink flush colored her cheeks, her eyes hazy with drink.


She glanced at the male escorts around her, each one young, striking, and sculpted to perfection. Yet,even in the middle of all that attention, a dull sadness weighed her down. She felt the urge to cry because no matter how much she drank, her thoughts kept drifting backto that bastard husband of hers.


Hannah lifted her wrist and flashed the diamond bracelet. "Whoever can make me the happiest tonight gets this," she remarked, her voice smooth and low. "It's worth a hundred grand."



It had been a gift from Vincent-something she used to treasure. But not anymore. She wanted neither thebracelet nor the man who gave it to her.


The escorts wasted no time. One started grinding up behind her, moving in rhythm with the music.Another leaned close, whispering sweet nothings in her ear.A third flexed his abs and chest as if showing off at a fitness competition.


Then, one of them, a little bolder than the rest,bent in close and murmured, "My tongue game's next-level.Wanna try?"


Hannah let out a languid smile. "Why not?" This guy was cute-puppy-eyed, gentle. Nothing like Vincent,whose sharp features and cold gaze always made him seem unapproachable. She'd been with Vincent long enough. Maybe it was time for a change of taste.


Unclasping the bracelet, Hannah handed it over without hesitation. "Take it. It's yours now."


As the guy leaned in for a kiss, Hannah matched his move with a grin. But before their lips could touch,a strong arm shot out, dragging her back against a  familiar chest.



The scent hit her instantly. Clean, cool, unmistakably him. She didn't even need to look up. She knew who it was."Let go of me," she murmured, her voice thick with liquor and stubborn pride. "I haven't even had the chance to kiss him yet."


Vincent held her tighter, not letting go. "Enough."


All around, the escorts froze in confusion and annoyance.





"Who the hell are you?" one of them questioned."You can't just take our client away."


Vincent's expression clouded over. "Leave," he instructed.





The weight of his voice left no room for argument.Every escort hurried to collect their things and scrambled to the door without another word.


Still holding Hannah close, Vincent caught sight of the bracelet-now in the hand of one of the retreating escorts.
"Wait," Vincent snapped. "Hand over the bracelet."
The guy stopped, glancing down at the jewelry. "But she gave it to me."
Vincent stared him down, completely unconvinced.He remembered that bracelet. Hannah cherished it like it was priceless. There was no chance she'd give it away if she were sober. This guy must have coaxed it out of her, taking advantage of her drunkenness.
"Give it back," Vincent said, his voice low and threatening.
Without further protest, the guy surrendered the bracelet.

Still tipsy, Hannah reached for the guy. "Don't leave yet," she called out, her voice dreamy. "Didn't you say your tongue was amazing? I haven't tested it yet..."
Hannah squirmed in Vincent's hold, pouting and whining, until he kissed her firmly. The fight left her in an instant.
 Later, once back home, Vincent pressed her gently against the door. Her hair tumbled in every direction,her gaze unfocused, and a bright flush colored her cheeks from the alcohol.
Vincent quietly slipped the bracelet back onto her wrist. "Wear it. I'll be around more often from now on."
A little laugh escaped her. So that was what he thought? That she was throwing a tantrum because he hadn't been home enough?
She tried to wriggle away, but he pulled her close again. She bristled in his arms, tense and ready to snap.
Vincent moved in slowly, his lips almost touching hers. That was when she caught the scent clinging to him. Another woman's perfume. Fury flashed through her as she shoved him back and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. "Don't touch me."

A wave of revulsion swept through her, and she darted into the bathroom.


Vincent was right behind her, barely a step away. He held her hair back as she bent over the sink, his palm resting gently on her back. "Is it really that bad?"
She didn't answer.
Just then, his phone vibrated. She managed to see the name on the screen-Brinley.
He stepped away to take the call. A moment passed before he returned, reached for his jacket, and said,"Work called.I have to head out."
Work? Hannah walked out of the bathroom, her eyes flickering toward the clock. The display read three a.m. Who would be calling about business in the middle of the night? It could only mean one thing.He must be leaving to meet his first love.
Hannah sobered up instantly. "Hold on. Your mother needs your signature on these papers." She rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a few documents, and passed them to him.
Vincent barely glanced at the pages as he scribbled   his name. He then walked out the door without looking back. Had he paid more attention, he would have realized the last document was a divorce agreement.

Brinley had called about a supposed sudden pain in her stomach, and Vincent had wasted no time driving her to the hospital, where he stayed until the morning.
When Vincent finally returned home, Hannah was still fast asleep, curled up in last night's clothes. He changed her into her pajamas, prepared a glass of lemon water, and placed it on the dining table before leaving quietly for work.
Hours passed, and Hannah woke up with a throbbing headache, feeling completely drained. She noted a text from Vincent on her phone."Are you feeling any better?"
She decided not to reply. Walking out of her room she spotted a glass of lemon water waiting for her on the dining table. "Thank you, Aubrey," she said to the housekeeper.
 Aubrey Palmer, the housekeeper, returned her gratitude with a smile. "Mrs. Jones, I think it was Mr.Jones who prepared this."

Hannah lowered her eyes. Thoughtfulness had always come naturally to Vincent, both when they were just dating and after they got married. Yet now,that kindness felt empty. He was gentle with her, not out of love, but because her face bore a resemblance to Brinley's. Brinley was the one he truly loved.

Hannah took a few careful sips. "Please take this away," she said to Aubrey.
She then reached for the divorce agreement and made a call to Danica. "You can get started on transferring the properties."
A spark of excitement came through in Danica's voice. "So he signed it?"
"Yes, he did." Hannah paused for a moment. "Let's hold off for a month before we tell everyone else in the family about the divorce. I'll move out after that."ight Her reason for waiting was simple. Sharon Jones,Vincent's grandmother, was about to turn seventy.Touched by Sharon's consistent kindness toward her,she couldn't bring herself to soil Sharon's mood by breaking out the divorce news.


When the call ended, "Nova Tech Rumored to Be Facing Bankruptcy" appeared on her phone news feed.


Nova Tech was the company Hannah had founded back in college. It had made a name for itself nationwide, specializing in women's safety products.But after getting married, she'd left behind her business, her dreams, and her entire future. She had lost herself completely in love, and Vincent had taken over her whole world.



Hannah's stomach dropped as she read the headline.Pondering for a while, she eventually got dressed to meet her old business partner, Felix Wade.
###Chapter 3 He Brought The OtherWoman Home

Felix looked up as soon as Hannah stepped inside his office, and his words came out sharp with sarcasm."The full-time housewife decided to show up and watch us fall apart? Sorry, I have work to do. Don't have time to entertain you."


Felix had a good reason to nurture displeasure toward Hannah. Back when the company had been a huge success with orders coming in faster than they could deal with, Hannah had walked away without even glancing back, and nobody had been able to make her stay. And in the five years since, she hadn't contacted anyone from the company-not even once. So seeing her now, he didn't bother to mince his words or mask his true feelings.


"I'm sorry for my past absence," Hannah said, voice soft as she lowered her gaze. "I only came hoping to find out if there's anything I can do to help."



A cold, bitter laugh escaped Felix. "Oh, are you done playing the perfect housewife behind closed doors?Thought you'd swing by and save us now?"


He tossed a folder onto the floor, the sound sharp in the quiet room. The glare in his eyes said it all. "It's too late. We don't need your help. The company's finished.You happy now?"


Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Hannah answered in an even tone, "Felix, I understand that you're upset. But we should focus on solving the company crisis right now."


Anger filled his voice. "We're on the brink of bankruptcy. What the hell can a full-time housewife like you do to change anything?" He didn't bother to wait for a reply, already gathering his things like he was leaving for good.


Her jaw clenched. Emotion flickered in her eyes. After a moment, she spoke. "I'm getting divorced."

 Felix stood frozen, disbelief written across his face."What did you just say?"


"If things unfold the way I expect, I'll walk away with a solid payout," she said, drawing out each word."So..." Reaching out her hand, she finished her thought. "So, what do you think? Want to bring our business back to life?"







Hannah made her way out of the company with a stack of documents, all provided by Felix, for her to grasp the company's crisis.


However, once home, as she nudged her room door open, she froze. Right there, on her bed, lay Brinley,tucked into Vincent's arms.


A chill swept through Hannah, leaving her numb.Suddenly, a laugh escaped her lips-not from amusement, but from her shattered heart and simmering fury. Vincent really couldn't help himself,could he? He was cheating in their house now? Or perhaps he just liked the thrill of being caught.
<###Chapter 3 He Brought The Other Woman Honie  +120 Po.nte at most "Seriously, Vincent, you're bringing the other woman to our house now?" Hannah demanded.

Vincent carefully helped Brinley sit up and then walked toward Hannah. "Why didn't you tell me before you left?"
Hannah sneered, "Why should I bother? It's not like my schedule has ever stopped you from inviting your latest fling over."
Vincent's voice dropped. "Brinley and I have known each other since we were kids. She's practically family. That's all. There's nothing between uS."
Hannah couldn't stop herself from rolling her eyes."Really? So, you're going to sleep with your 'family'now?"

Tension tightened Vincent's face. He opened his mouth to reply, but Brinley beat him to it.

Brinley offered her hand. "Hi, I'm Brinley. It's good to finally meet you. People always told me we look a lot alike." She then glanced at Vincent. "
misunderstand. Vincent was only helping me earlier..."



Hannah kept her arms at her sides and let her annoyance show. She had no intention of returning Brinley's gesture. A sharp edge crept into her words."Misunderstand what? That you threw yourself at my husband?"



Brinley's lips pressed together as she turned a wounded gaze on Vincent.


A cold, hard note filled Vincent's voice. "Hannah, I've already explained the situation to you. Stop making a fuss over nothing."


"Making a fuss over nothing? Isn't she your first love?" Mixed feelings crept into Hannah's face. Her voice dropped as she finally let out the question that had haunted her since witnessing the scene the other day. "Vincent, did you only marry me because l look like her?" She swung her arm to point straight at Brinley, eyes fixed on Vincent the whole time.

 
Vincent shifted his gaze away. No answer came from his lips.


That silence hurt worse than anything he could have said. Hannah felt something break inside her.Deep down, she had already known the answer, but seeing the truth come out in his silence felt like someone had cut right through her. A bitter laugh slipped out."I get it. Let's just get a divorce. There's no point in dragging this relationship out."


Vincent's brow furrowed. "Really? Throwing a divorce threat over this minor issue? When can you be a little more mature?" His expression turned cold. "Fine.Since you don't like Brinley, I won't bring her around anymore.Satisfied?"


Hannah didn't bother to respond. She'd already tricked him into signing the divorce agreement. She was set on walking away from this torment of marriage,and arguing with him seemed pointless.


Vincent's tone made it clear the conversation was over. "This whole fuss ends right now. I don't want to hear another word about divorce."
 With that, he led Brinley to the door.


Hannah wasted no time in asking the housekeeper to prepare a spare bedroom. She would not sleep on the bed tainted by his sweetheart again.


She thought about how she and Vincent had dated for three years before marriage and then spent five more as husband and wife. Her feelings for him had started with nothing more than the appeal of his looks.



At that time, he had just been fresh out of a heartbreak from the end of a relationship. Drawn in by his good looks, she'd practically glued to his side every single day to make her feelings transparent. To anyone willing to hear her out, she'd remarked with certainty, "I'm going to make Vincent Jones fall in love with me."



Her strategy had been simple-bringing him flowers every day, showing up with snacks, and asking him,again and again, "Fallen for me yet?"


Back then, she had been bold. She'd declared her love for him in front of anyone, never bothered by the eyes watching her. Most days, however, Vincent had acted like she didn't even exist.



Later on, a moment alone in the university equipment storage room had finally given her the chance she wanted. Cornering him against the wall, she'd flashed a playful grin and teased, "If you don't say yes to being my boyfriend, I'm going to kiss you right now."



That day, he hadn't said yes or no. Instead,he'd simply pulled her into his arms. Now, as she looked back, she realized she shouldn't have taken his silence as agreement.


The reason their marriage fell apart was painfully simple. Vincent's love for her had never been strong enough to hold it together. And she'd poured everything into him, loving with all her heart,yet what she received always fell short of her expectations leaving her frustrated. Over time, disappointment weighed her down until her heart went numb.Brinley's presence simply became the last push that broke her completely.
On the way to drive Brinley back, Vincent's expression stayed stormy. Brinley reached out, her fingers brushing his arm. "Vincent,I-"
He moved away from her touch. "Brinley, make sure today's event never repeats itself."
###Chapter 4 It Was Brinley's Voice




For several days straight, Vincent returned home each night just in time fordinner with Hannah. Every evening, as soon as the meal ended, he hurried right back to his office.


That particular night, Hannah turned in early. The next day, morning light woke her, and she soon noticed an arm draped around her waist. Vincent had come into the guest room and fallen asleep beside her.She could not recall the last time he slept at home.


When she tried to slip away, his hold only tightened.The closeness sent her heart into a wild rhythm.


"You're awake?" he murmured, his voice hoarse from the sleep.


"Yeah."


"I got something for you." He straightened up and reached for an elegant gift box resting on the nightstand.
"This purple gemstone necklace-it's one of a kind."His tone grew gentle. "Would you like me to put it on you?"
Hannah let him, gathering her hair to make room as he fastened the necklace around her neck.He always knew what suited her. The color brought out the best in her features.
Without warning, Vincent leaned closer, his lips skimming along the side of her neck and sending a tickling shiver across her skin. "Didn't Grandma mention we should think about having a baby?" His hand moved slowly toward the edge of her dress."Why don't we make one now?"

His familiar scent closed in around her, and her body instinctively responded. Eight years of loving Vincent had left its mark. Every reaction gave her feelings away. But she was no longer the girl she had been eight years ago. Logic now held more power over her than longing ever could. A divorce loomed over them.
She could not imagine bringing a child into a marriage on the verge of ending.
Carefully, Hannah placed a hand on his chest and pushed him back. "I'm not feeling up to it today."
Vincent made another attempt. "Is something wrong?"

A quiet answer left her lips."No, I'm just tired."
He heard the finality in her voice and knew she meant every word. Reluctantly, he let her go. Still restless, he decided to take a cold shower. But before he could reach the bathroom, his phone buzzed with a call from Brinley.A scowl crossed his face. Muttering about needing to get back to work,he left the room.

Hannah had no doubts about who he was really going to meet-Brinley. Once he was gone, she sat up and pulled out the documents Felix had handed her. The hours slipped by as she read through every page. Her notes filled every margin of the documents -page corners dog-eared, sections underlined，
 questions scribbled in bold.Reaching for her phone, she sent Felix a message."Are you available? I've got some questions about the company."
His response came without delay. "Let's talk over dinner tomorrow. And it's your treat."

The following day, they met at the Gilded Restaurant.Felix spent most of the meal outlining the company's struggles from the last few years. Hannah listened intently, concern visible in the lines on her face.
She tapped the stack of papers in front of her. "Have you noticed how our women's safety products have all started to look and feel the same? There's nothing
new anymore."
Felix nodded. "We have tried to bring in new ideas,but nothing seemed to take off."

"Have you ever thought about using Al? We could develop a smart assistant that would really transform our whole product lineup."
Felix leaned back and answered honestly, "The idea has come up, but with our company struggling, no one wants to partner with us."


A spark of hope lit her voice. "I heard the CEO of VitraMind is coming back to the country. Maybe we could-"



Before she could finish, a familiar voice interrupted her. "Well, what a coincidence. Fancy seeing you here."



Brinley approached their table, smiling.


The moment Hannah spotted Brinley, her mood soured. "Don't act like we're that close."



Then, Hannah's eyes landed on the necklace around Brinley's neck, the very same purple gemstone necklace Vincent had claimed was "'one of a kind."She sneered inwardly. So much for one of a kind. He had given her and Brinley each an identical gemstone necklace. She should have known better than to trust his words.

Having made her point, Brinley turned and walked off,but not before casually snapping a photo of Hannah and Felix together from a distance.


Elsewhere, Vincent was busy sending a text to Hannah. "I'll be home for dinner tonight." He believed that after last night, things had gone back to normal.He hadn't taken her talk of divorce seriously and just assumed it was another outburst. In his mind,she loved him too much to walk away.


Suddenly, his phone vibrated. A photo arrived.It showed Hannah at dinner with another man. He zoomed in, noticing right away that she wasn't wearing her wedding ring. A muscle jumped in his jaw, and his eyes went cold.


Meanwhile,since Gilded Restaurant was known as a gathering spot for the city's wealthy, that afternoon,besides running into Brinley, Hannah also crossed paths with several people from the privileged circle.


Voices drifted behind her, sharp enough to cut.


"Looks like Hannah's hooked herself a new loaded Voice guy.""You didn't hear? Brinley's back in town. Vincent must have dumped her already."
"Word is, Vincent drove Brinley back after she got wasted last night."
"Seriously? And Hannah just let it slide?"
"Probably settled with money. H fast, doesn't she? Already has som side."	annah moves on eone new by her
"Honestly, Hannah is a stunner. That figure, that face... Man, I'd pay just to get a handful.Wonder what her rate is?"

The men burst out laughing, crude and careless, not bothering to keep their voices down.

Hannah glanced at Felix, giving him a small smile."Excuse me a moment. I have something to handle."

She then strode right over to the group of men, her smile steady. "Were you talking about me?"
Some of the men shrank back, but one spoke up,bold as ever. "What? It's not like we've said anything wrong.You were never even Vincent's girlfriend-just a kept woman. Now you're out, and we're not allowed to talk about it?"

Hannah's smile turned sharper. "Actually, you couldn't have been more wrong. When I was with Vincent, Brinley wasn't even in the picture yet.I got bored and tossed him aside. Understand?"

Then, she fixed her eyes on the man who'd made the crude joke. "And as for you?" She sized him up from head to toe, her smile cold. "You look likean overstuffed pig in an expensive shirt. I'd rather kill myself than let you anywhere near me."

Without missing a beat, she grabbed a glass of red wine and splashed it right across his chest.

The man shot to his feet, rage twisting his face, and reached for her. Felix moved quicker, stepping in between them and seizing the man's wrist. His voice stayed calm. "Trying to lay hands on a woman? Real classy."
"Ouch! Damn it. Let go!" the man cried out in pain.
Felix tightened his grip just a little. "If I held on any tighter, you'd be in a sling." A hard look from him followed."Now scram."
The man hurried off, humiliated and red-faced.
Hannah smiled at Felix, her tone light. "Appreciate it.But I am afraid we'll have to finish our conversation another time."
Felix shrugged. "No worries. We'll pick it up next time." He took a moment to study her expression. "If I'm not mistaken, you were married to Vincent,right?" Nothing like those rumors about her being kept.
She answered without hesitation, "Yeah. But divorce is on the way."
There was a flicker of delight in his eyes, though quickly followed by concern. "Did he treat you badly?"
A pause followed before Hannah replied, "We just couldn't make it work anymore." She looked away and gave a dry laugh. "Funny, isn't it? When I left the company five years ago, I really thought I'd be happy.Looks like I was wrong."


Felix shook his head. "That's alright. You get married to be happy. You leave for the same reason."


A small smile played on her lips. "That's true."


They fell into step together, walking side by side. As they passed a private dining room, a high, breathless woman's voice echoed into the hall. "Vincent... Don't stop... Ah, right there... Yes, that's perfect... You feel incredible..."



Hannah stopped in her tracks. There was no mistaking it-Brinley's voice. Her legs refused to budge despite her desire to leave. Tears gathered in her eyes and fell before she could blink them away.
###Chapter 5 Moved Out
Hearing the woman's moan floating from inside the private room, Felix caught on at once and quickly steered Hannah away.


Barely aware of her own steps, Hannah drifted forward, her gaze unfocused. Felix stayed by her side, neither of them saying a word for quite some time.



"You should go back," Hannah said quietly. "I'm fine by myself."


Felix shook his head. "Let me take you home."


A pause hung between them before she gave in."Alright."


It was already past midnight by the time they reached Hannah's place.



One unshakable thought dominated Hannah's thoughts-she needed to gather her things and move out. There was no way she would spend another night with Vincent under the same roof.


Vincent was already home, waiting for Hannah's return. His eyes narrowed the instant he recognized Felix, the same man from that photograph. The tension in his jaw made it impossible to miss his displeasure.


"Why did you come back so late?" Vincent asked,though Hannah paid him no attention. She moved past him and walked straight to her room.


Felix gave a short, mocking laugh. "You're fast. Did you enjoy yourself?"


Vincent didn't respond to Felix's inexplicable jab. He plastered on a polite smile, his voice cool. "Thanks for bringing my wife home." He made a point of stressing the words "my wife" before turning around.


Felix nearly laughed at his misplaced possessiveness. In the end, he said nothing and left quietly.
Vincent strode into the bedroom and caught Hannah stuffing clothes into her suitcase. His brows furrowed as he walked over and yanked the luggage from her hands. "Where do you think you're going at this late hour?" The words came out sharp and brittle.


That photograph of Hannah dining with another man had haunted Vincent all day. Even after he wrapped up at the office, the image hadn't left his mind.He'd rushed back home, only to find it empty. His calls to Hannah went unanswered. Thus, he waited for her to return home.



For hours, the house stayed empty. And now, when she finally came back, she wasn't alone-she had come back with the very man from the photo, the one she had dined with.



Not sparing him a look, Hannah kept gathering her belongings. Her tone was cold. "It's not your problem."


Anger flickering across his eyes, he grabbed her wrist sharply. His grip was rough-too tight. She tried to wriggle free but failed. Red marks quickly appeared, pain radiating up her arm.


Realizing what he'd done, he reined himself in and muttered, "Didn't mean to."


Hannah's body shook, her mind flooded with scenes conjured up based on Brinley's moans-images of Vincent and Brinley making love. Disgust and anger washed over her in an instant. With a fierce push, she shoved him aside. "Get out of my way. I'm moving out."



His brow tightened with confusion. "This is your home. Where do you plan to run off to?"


A hollow laugh escaped her lips as tears tracked down her cheek. She wiped them away quickly,her voice dropping to a whisper. "This place stopped feeling like home the moment you lét Brinley through the door."



Vincent stiffened as he grasped her meaning immediately. He frowned, frustration bubbling up."You're overthinking it. I told you. There's nothing between us. If you really hate her that much, I'll keep her away from here. That's it. She'll never come to our home again."


Vincent's arms wrapped around her waist from behind, pulling her into his arms, her back against his chest. His hold was firm, almost desperate.


Frost gathered in Hannah's eyes. She'd caught him with Brinley three times. And he still expected her to believe himn? How ridiculous.



She tried to break free from his embrace, but he held her tightly. "Let go of me,"she said, her voice sharp as glass.


His grip only tightened. "No. You're not leaving me.Not ev/er."



Facing off with Vincent never got her anywhere.She knew that all too well. There was no winning in a head-on fight. So, she stopped struggling, her shoulders lowering, and she softened her voice to a whisper. "Alright, you win, I'll stay, Just let go of me."


Vincent shifted to face her, loosening his grip just enough, but still kept his arms wrapped around her waist, his face nestled into the crook of her neck. He loved holding her like this.

But then, an unwelcome thought gnawed at Vincent.The image of the man who'd dropped Hannah home wouldn't leave him alone. His tone turned cold. "Who exactly was the guy who dropped you off?"
Without missing a beat, Hannah gave an indifferent answer. "Just a friend," she said, inching her body away from his grasp.
Vincent's grip only tightened as suspicion crept in.His voice dropped lower. "Strange-I don't recall you ever introducing us."
No answer came from her lips. Rarely did Vincent concern himself with the details of her world. For as long as she could remember, she'd always revolved around him, never the other way around.
Sensing her mood shift, Vincent tried to steer the conversation elsewhere."Once things settle down,let's take a trip. Clear our heads a little-then maybe we can try for a baby."


In the past, hearing such words would have sent Hannah over the moon. Now, however, the words just washed over her, meaningless. He had been tricked by her into signing the divorce agreement without even realizing it. Only twenty-three days left before his grandmother's seventieth birthday. Once the celebration wrapped up, she would walk away from his world entirely.


Hannah just gave a soft, noncommittal response.


Vincent's fingers traced the outline of her bare ring finger. A faint indentation lingered where her wedding ring once sat. "Did you take your ring off?"


Hannah slid her hand free. "Lost it accidentally," she replied, voice barely above a whisper.


Undeterred, Vincent caught her hand once more, his thumb sweeping over the faint mark on her ring finger. "It's been years. Maybe it's time we redesigned the set. Tell me what style you like-I'll have someone draw it up."
Nothing about the conversation appealed to her."Let's talk about it latershe said, shutting the topic down. She nudged him away, her tone turning brisk as she thought of his getting laid with Brinley. "You should get cleaned up."

A smile crossed his face as he tugged her closer."Why don't you join me? It's been forever since we shared a shower."

She stepped back and shook her head, her words deliberately misleading him. "You go ahead. Didn't you say we should try making a baby?"
"Alright," Vincent replied, starting to loosen his tie as he disappeared into the bathroom.
The second the door clicked shut, Hannah snatched up her phone. She dialed her closest friend, Rena Brown. "Can you come get me?"
Within ten minutes, headlights flashed in the driveway. Rena had arrived. Hannah didn't bother packing anymore. All she grabbed was a folder of company documents before heading out the door.
When Vincent finally stepped out from the bathroom,water still dripping from his hair, he saw only an empty room. His wife was gone.

 ###Chapter 6 Is That What You ReallyTell Your Mistress About Me

Once picking up Hannah and taking her to her place Rena arranged things with quiet efficiency. She made sure Hannah had everything she could possibly need.

Years of friendship since their college days meant Rena knew the whole story-from Hannah's first date with Vincent to the unraveling of their marriage.
Once the fresh linens were in place, Rena glanced over her shoulder and handed Hannah a pilloW."You're really done with Vincent this time, aren't you?No going back?"
Without missing a beat, Hannah took the pillow and nodded. "Yes. Even the idea of going back makes my skin crawl."

Instant approval flashed in Rena's eyes. "You deserve better, you know that. I never saw what you did in him."


There was no hesitation in Rena's voice-she'd always been against Vincent. Watching Hannah leave him felt like watching someone finally wake up from a bad dream. Anyone who met Hannah couldn't miss her striking looks-tall, elegant, skin like porcelain,and hair that caught the light in soft amber waves.She had the kind of presence that turned heads, so why spend another second on a man who never valued her?



Rena broke the brief silence. "Alright, what's your next move?"



Determination flared in Hannah's eyes. "It's simple.I'm bringing Nova Tech back. That's my only focus now." She paused and then looked hopeful. "Actually Rena, do you have a way to help me connect with Miles Whitaker-the CEO of VitraMind?" If there was ever a person to open doors in the elite's world,it was Rena. Her connections seemed endless, though even she sometimes hit a wall.
 Hearing that name, Rena had frowned for the first time all night. "Miles isn't easy to reach. Best I can do is find out where he'll be and when."


Hannah smiled, grateful. "That's more than enough."


Night stretched on as the two friends talked about everything and nothing, until Rena finally drifted off to sleep.


Alone in the quiet, Hannah nursed a beer, her thoughts involuntarily spiraling back to Vincent. How did things between them end up like this? All these years together, he'd never really opened his heart to her. He hadn't even offered a single explanation for treating her as a stand-in. Nobody could call this anything but a farce. Deep down, she understood.She'd never truly mattered to him. Love had never been part of the equation.



Tears stung her eyes, but she brushed them away with a shaky hand. Right then, she made herself a promise: this would be the last time she'd cried over Vincent.
Morning sunlight found Danica hunching over a chessboard with Brinley as her opponent.
Out of nowhere,Danica's phone buzzed. Hannah's name lit up the screen.
Pausing the game, Danica flashed the caller ID toward Brinley before answering. "What's up?"
"Are the property transfer procedures done?"Hannah's voice sounded rough, as if she hadn't slept at all.

A quick exchange of looks passed between Danica and Brinley. "Of course not. Only three went through," Danica responded, her words crisp.
"Hand those over first," Hannah replied.
"Alright, just swing by when you get a chance."Leaning back, Danica remarked, deliberately sounding casual, "By the way, I heard you moved out."

The memory of Vincent's late-night phone call about whether Hannah had come to her place and his  anxious tone flashed through Danica's mind.


"Yeah," Hannah answered and then ended the call without a moment's pause.


Danica frowned at the blank screen. "How rude," she muttered to herself.


But the moment Danica looked at Brinley, her lips curled into a smile. "Anyway, their divorce is done.Hannah's moving out just suits you. Things get a whole lot easier for you to grow close to Vincent."


Brinley dropped her gaze with mock shyness and played with a strand of hair, but her tone betrayed her smugness. "You know, Mrs. Jones, there's still plenty of road ahead for me."


Grinning wide, Danica could barely contain her excitement."Won't be long now. I can already picture you as part of the family." A dramatic sigh escaped her lips. "The real tragedy is having to sign away so many properties to Hannah."


An eager glimmer flashed in Brinley's eyes. "I might  be able to help you keep what's yours."


Curiosity sparked immediately across Danica's face."Really? How?" Choosing Brinley as her future daughter-in-law suddenly felt like the best decision she'd ever made.


Later that day, Hannah stopped by Danica's place to collect the property paperwork. Expecting Danica,she ran into Brinley instead.


"Well,look who itBrinley remarked, her voice as sweet as honey but her smile sharp as a knife.


Without a word, Hannah kept moving, clutching her phone and heading straight for the stairs.


Brinley wasn't finished. "At Gilded Restaurant the other day, you heard me and Vincent make out in the private room,didn't you?"


Unfazed, Hannah shot her a glare. "So? Wrecking someone else's marriage-does that really make you proud of yourself?"

 
A flicker of discomfort crossed Brinley's face before she smoothed it over with a fresh smile. "If I hadn't walked away back then, you'd never have had your shot with him." Drawing closer, she lowered her voice. "You want to know what Vincent told me during our encounters? He said you just lie there,stiff as a board, making him do all the work and stripping him of any pleasure from having sex with you."


Without warning, Hannah raised her phone, the screen lit up to show an active call. Her expression turned ice-cold. "Vincent, is that what you really tell your mistress about me?"
###Chapter 7 Moving Into Her NewHome
A storm passed over Brinley's face as her fists tightened at her sides.
With her arms crossed and one eyebrow raised,Hannah gave Brinley a look. "Don't hold back now.Let's hear the rest."

Brinley retorted, "Do you seriously believe any of this will get between Vincent and me?"
With a dismissive laugh, Hannah waved her off."Don't talk like I am interested in winning my husband back. You already slept with him. I don't want him anymore."
Refusing to let the conversation drag on, Hannah made her way upstairs to find Danica.
Brinley's voice rang out from behind, sharp and loaded. "Let me make something clear. The only reason Vincent married you is that he took you as a stand-in during my absence."
Stopping on the landing, Hannah looked back,her tone as steady as ever. "Then let me remind you of something. Vincent is my husband, on paper and in reality. You? You'll never be anything more than his shameless mistress."
With her head held high, Hannah didn't spare another glance as she continued up the steps, every move confident. When she reached Danica, she collected three property deeds and slipped out of the house without saying goodbye.
Vincent arrived barely a minute later, urgency in every step. He rushed into the living room and looked around, only to find no sign of Hannah, the person he wanted to see. "Hannah's left already?" He didn't bother disguising his frustration.

Brinley, eager to stir things up, decided to mention the man she'd seen with Hannah at the Gilded Restaurant. "Yeah, she left. And she wasn't alone.Some guy picked herup."
Vincent's face clouded even more.


The sound of footsteps signaled Danica's descent from upstairs. Seeing her son, she broke into a smile."It's been so long since you came home. Why not stay for dinner tonight? Brinley's here too. Maybe the three of us could catch up like old times."


Vincent shook his head, voice devoid of warmth."I've got work to finish." He glanced over at Brinley."We need to talk. Alone."


Vincent didn't bother looking back as he stepped out of the living room.


Brinley lingered in the doorway, uncertainty shadowing her features before she trailed after him.Her lips parted, ready to speak, but Vincent's voice cut through the tension. "When did I ever sleep with you? Why did you fabricate such things to my wife?"


His tone was grave, eyes locked on her with piercing clarity.


A moment passed before Brinley seemed to crumble.
Tears shimmered in her eyes, sudden and raw, as if he'd laid her soul bare. "Vincent, my feelings for you never disappeared. Watching you and Hannah together-it tore me apart. I blurted out those things because I wanted you to care for me again. Weren't we crazy about each other once?"
She reached out, wrapping her arms around his waist in a desperate embrace. He moved away, breaking her grip. "I am married," he said, steady and unwavering. "Don't say such words again,especially when Hannah's around. The only reason I go out of my way to look after you now is because of your father."

Brinley's voice cracked, desperate. "But Hannah means nothing to you. She's just a stand-in!"
"No," Vincent retorted firmly. "She's my wife."Without another word, he turned his back on her and left.
Silent tears streaked down Brinley's face, but in their wake, a sharp and calculating glimmer appeared. A stand-in had managed to claim everything she believed belonged to her. What did Hannah have that she lacked?


...

Hannah sold off the three properties. A staggering five hundred million hit her bank account without warning.
She started by clearing every outstanding debt and settling all the company's unpaid salaries. After that,she purchased a house in Sterling Heights, the most prestigious and heavily guarded neighborhood in all of Dorbarrow. The people who lived there weren't just wealthy or influential-they were both.
She bought the house to live in by herself and avoid being located by Vincent. Deep down, she doubted he would chase after her anyway. Expecting that much from him felt foolish.

Her first evening behind those guarded gates brought an unexpected twist. Instead of quiet solitude, she brought in a troupe of sharply dressed male escorts-less for their company, more for the show of it.


Each man stood at attention, shirts unbuttoned just enough to reveal hard muscle and practiced confidence. They all understood the art of being admired.


As Hannah lounged with a glass of red wine, she ran her finger along one man's sculpted arm, more curious than captivated.


Even with laughter and music swirling around her, a hollowness pressed in. Her mind, stubborn as ever,wandered back to the one person she shouldn't miss. Vincent's physique wasn't nearly as impressive,but his body had always felt perfect to her. Nothing compared to the memory of tracing his sweat-slicked abs after their most passionate nights-soft,heated,alive beneath her touch. And then, after the heat of the moment, he'd always murmur her nickname "Anna" in that quiet, hungry way, and then pull her close for another round.


Her thoughts were spiraling somewhere they shouldn't be when her phone rang, snapping her out of it. Rena's name flashed on the screen. "Hannah, I just heard-Miles landed today. He came in through the VIP terminal. Want to head to the airport and catch him?"
###Chapter 8 Another Woman Already

Without hesitation, Hannah pushed herself up from the couch. "Send me Miles' flight details. I'll be there in minutes," she said, determination in her eyes as she hung up.
A message pinged onto her phone moments later.According to the message, Miles would be touching down at nine. The clock read eight thirty. Wasting no time, she tossed a bank card to the group of male escorts. "We're done for the evening. Take care of yourselves," she said before waving them out.
Keys in hand, Hannah hurried to the garage and slid into her car, nerves thrumming.
Before she knew it, the airport entrance loomed ahead-barely two minutes to spare before eight thirty.
Crowds packed the VIP terminal, reporters elbowing for space as they waited for a glimpse of Miles.

Hannah kept her distance. Across the sea of cameras and chaos, she spotted a man with his face hidden beneath a cap, flanked by guards. Strangely, Kenneth Adams, Miles's loyal assistant, was nowhere to be found. A hunch told her that wasn't the real Miles out there.


Moving quickly, she made her way down to the parking garage below. Sure enough, the elevator doors slid open to reveal a tall man stepping out, with Kenneth trailing just behind. She called out, her breath still ragged, "Mr. Whitaker, may I have a moment?"


Kenneth immediately stepped forward, shieldng Miles from her approach. "Mr. Whitaker isn't giving interviews tonighnt. You'll have to excuse us."


"I'm not with the press," Hannah replied, shaking her head.



Trying to make herself heard, she peered around Kenneth and addressed the man in the crisp suit, "I represent Nova Tech. I'd like to discuss a partnership  "People keep showing up wanting to strike a business deal with me. Why should I waste time with you?" Miles said coolly, his tone distant. He gazed at her briefly before looking away with a frown. "Can't even manage your own clothes, apparently."


Glancing down, Hannah finally noted that her bra strap was on full display, neckline slipping lower than she realized. She must have tugged it out of place in her rush. In a rush, she straightened her outfit,silently scolding herself, "Perfect. Now he probably thinks I'm throwing myself at himn."


One quick signal from Miles, and Kenneth opened the car door to pull out a tailored jacket, offering it in her direction.


Hannah blinked in surprise. "I... Appreciate it," she said, still catching her breath. A glimmer of opportunity sparked in her eyes. "Would you mind sharing a number? I'll return the jacket to Mr.Whitaker later," she said, hoping for a connection.


"No need for that," Kenneth replied with no warmth at all. "Mr. Whitaker doesn't wear anything once  someone else has touched it."


Switching her focus back to Miles, Hannah tried again, refusing to let the moment slip away. Whitaker, has Nova Tech ever come up in your research? We're pushing Al into women's safety products.I think-"


She took a step forward, attempting to close the gap,but Kenneth positioned himself directly in her path.


Miles slid into the back seat and said nothing more.


Kenneth's eyes narrowed as he gave her a dismissive look, not bothering to hide his irritation. "I've seen your type before. You're lucky Mr. Whitaker's polite-otherwise, you'd be leaving here with nothing but regret." He then hopped into the car.


With a deep growl, the car's engine started up and the luxury sedan disappeared into the night.


Impulse told Hannah to give chase, her feet already moving toward the exit.


Suddenly, the elevator chimed and slid open right  someone else has touched it."


Switching her focus back to Miles, Hannah tried again, refusing to let the moment slip away. Whitaker, has Nova Tech ever come up in your research? We're pushing Al into women's safety products.I think-"


She took a step forward, attempting to close the gap,but Kenneth positioned himself directly in her path.

With a deep growl, the car's engine started up and the luxury sedan disappeared into the night.


Impulse told Hannah to give chase, her feet already moving toward the exit.


Suddenly, the elevator chimed and slid open right beside her. Every muscle tensed as Vincent stepped out, another woman by his side, and Bobby lagging just behind them. A pang of hurt raced through her chest.


Bobby, of course, had been here to connect with Miles, dragging Vincent along to keep up appearances. But with reporters flooding the terminal, their plans had shifted to collecting Miles's sister instead.


Catching sight of Hannah in the garage, Vincent was visibly caught off guard. "What brings you here?" he asked, confusion flickering in his eyes.


Only then did a new thought occur to him-maybe she'd discovered his schedule and come here just to see him. So she still cared.


His lips parted, ready to say more, but Hannah didn't give him the chance. Her words cut the air between them. "Another woman already, Mr. Jones? That was fast."
###Chapter 9 An Accidental Slap
Vincent's brow furrowed. He looked at Hannah,clearly displeased. "Do you have to talk like that?"


Hannah adjusted the jacket draped over her shoulders and raised an eyebrow. "Did I say something wrong?" A smirk curled her lips.ne woman after another-aren't you worried you'll wear yourself out? Would hate for fatigue to be your undoing,Mr.Jones."



The comment sat poorly with Vincent. At what point had Hannah become this sharp-tongued? His eyes lingered on the jacket draped on her shoulder-obviously a man's, and definitely not his own. A wave of suspicion crashed over him. Was she here to see off some man at the airport? Clearing his throat, he asked, "What are you doing at the airport?"



With barely a glance back, Hannah let out a huff and strode away, making it clear she was done with the conversation.



But the next second, Vincent strode forward and grabbed her wrist, "Where do you think you're going?"



"None of your business," Hannah snapped, her words clipped as she tried to twist out of his grasp.But he refused to let go.


"Still making a fuss?" Vincent asked, frustration clear in every word.


A hollow, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. Making a fuss? She hadn't made a scene or harmed anyone -just kept all her pain to herself. Yet, somehow, he viewed her as immature, making a fuss. All at once,the fight in her faded. A heavy silence settled over her.



"I didn't make a fuss," Hannah finally said, her voice level and steady.


Vincent picked up on the change, his own tone softening. "Let's head home. We need to talk this out."



A bitter laugh escaped from Hannah. "Home? That word doesn't mean anything to us. To everyone else,I was never your wife-just a secret lover, right?"


In fact, she wasn't even a lover. She was just a stand-in for Brinley. And for five years, she'd been kept in the dark.


Their eyes met, her gaze heavy with pain,disappointment, and a thousand other feelings that words couldn't touch.



Every bit of her heartbreak was written on her face,and Vincent saw it. The sight nearly closed up his throat.



She turned to leave again, but Vincent gripped her wrist even more tightly. He tugged her back, urging her toward his car.



His strength overpowered her resistance. Rage bubbled up inside her. Her arm flew out,accidentally connecting with his cheek in a sharp, stinging slap.
For a split second, the sound echoed around them.Hannah stood perfectly still, shocked by what she'd just done.

His head slapped to the side, Vincent set his jaw and pressed his tongue to the inside of his cheek. His eyes narrowed, shadows flickering in their depths."Can we talk now?"

Without waiting for an answer, he yanked her to the car and shoved her inside before slamming the door shut and speeding away before she could protest.
Behind them, Daphne Whitaker, Miles' younger sister,watched from the curb, her mouth falling open as the car disappeared. "Who was that woman? Did she really slap Mr. Jones?"
Bobby scoffed. "Just some lover. Not worth mentioning."

Meanwhile, silence hung thick inside the Bentley.Hannah turned her head, watching the outline of Vincent's cheek where her hand had landed. Her heart churned with regret. After all the years they'd spent together, she'd never once struck him-this was the first time.


Only then did Vincent finally release her wrist,his gaze catching on the faint red line his grip had left behind.


Delicate skin had always betrayed Hannah's bruises.Every time they'd been intimate, her body would be dotted with love marks, some lasting for days.


His throat bobbed at the memory. Slowly, he reached over, brushing his thumb over the mark as if he could erase it.



The touch jolted Hannah back to reality. She snatched her hand away. "What exactly do you want to talk to me about?"



Regaining his composure, Vincent answered,"Grandma's seventieth birthday is coming up soon.You haven't forgotten, have you?"


"Of course I remember," she replied. Three weeks-that was all the time left. Once his grandmother's birthday celebration wrapped up, she would vanish from his world entirely and announce their divorce publicly.


Turning away, Hannah fixed her attention on the scenery outside. Her fingers absentmindedly traced the pale impression left by a wedding band that was no longer there.


Again and again, Vincent glanced over at her profile.Each time, a feeling of powerlessness crept in, like she was slipping out of his orboit and there was nothing he could do.


"You've always taken charge of Grandma's birthday plans," he said, his tone softening. "Seventieth birthday is a big milestone. Do you have any ideas for the celebration?"



Hannah said nothing.


Vincent's eyes dimmed slightly, though he tried to mask it. "Maybe we could skip the big party this time.Something simple-a family dinner. I think that would mean a lot to her."
A tired breath slipped from Hannah, her words scraping the air. "You don't have to ask me, Vincent.There's probably someone out there who could do it better."



Vincent's face clouded over in an instant. His eyes locked on hers as he demanded, "And what's that supposed to mean? Are you telling me to divorce you and go marry another woman who handles the celebration?"
###Chapter 10Irritating





"I meant it might be smarter to let a real party planner handle the celebration. I'd probably just mess it up," Hannah explained, her tone flat.


The tension on Vincent's expression eased a little.


Hannah curled her lips into a slight smile and added,"But if you want to divorce me and marry someone else, I won't stand in your way."



Vincent tugged at his tie, a cold smirk spreading across his lips. "You really want me to marry someone else? Are you eager to ditch me?"


While keeping her eyes fixed on the window, Hannah answered with zero hesitation, "Of course. I got tired of seeing your face every day."


Suddenly, Vincent leaned in, his crisp, masculine scent wafting into her nostrils. His voice dropped to a whisper. "So what's wrong with my face, exactly?"
Hannah turned her head, only to find his chiseled features dangerously close. Her lashes fluttered,and her heart thudded in her chest. He'd always been ridiculously handsome. That was why she'd chased after him all those years ago. He never bothered with fancy cologne. Somehow, he always smelled crisp and magnetic, without even trying.


Thick silence pressed between them, heavy as a rainstorm. Vincent eventually made a low humming sound, urging her for an answer.


Without missing a beat, Hannah reached up and nudged his face aside. "Even the best-looking guy starts to look the same after seeing every single day for a while."


A shadow passed over Vincent's face, the mood in the car sinking a few degrees. "You really want to get on my nerves, don't you?"


Her lips curled into a half-smile. "I'm just saying what's on my mind. You're way better at irritating people than Iam."
No one spoke for a few seconds, and the atmosphere was thick enough to cut. Up front, Derek Barrett,Vincent's assistant, shrank back in his seat,wishing he could disappear altogether.


Out of nowhere, Vincent circled back. "Grandma's turning seventy. The birthday party is your responsibility."


Hannah's first instinct was to refuse. They were getting divorced-keeping their distance would be best.



As she started to voice her refusal, Vincent jumped in first. "She adores you. You really want to let her down?"



The words hit like a brick. From the moment Hannah married into the Jones family, Sharon had always offered the gentlest welcome. Whenever Danica's words stung or Vincent seemed to vanish from her world, it was Sharon who stood by her side.


Lately, Sharon's strength was fading, age catching up with her in small,quiet ways. Hannah had always
intended to wait until this birthday passed before bringing up the divorce. Most likely, this would be their last celebration together. So why was she still second-guessing herself?


A breath escaped her lips as she answered, "Fine.I'll do it."


Relief softened Vincent's sharp features. "That settles it. Starting now, we'll move back to the Jones family house. Everything you need will be there."


"Okay," Hannah replied, her voice flat as stone.


With a sidelong glance, Vincent studied her profile,something unshakable gnawing at his chest.


The rest of the ride passed in silence as the Bentley cruised toward the Jones family estate.


A solitary figure stood by the iron gates,waiting with apparent purpose.


Catching sight of Brinley through the car window,Hannah's heart dropped. She turned to Vincent, her words clipped and cold. "You should have mentioned
Brinley was here."


He picked up on her irritation right away and rushed to calm the moment."She won't be around long. It's only temporary."


A nod was all he received. Hannah wasted no energy arguing as she stepped out of the car. Last time she and Brinley spoke, things had turned sour fast. But this was the Jones house. Danica and Vincent had agreed to let Brinley stay, and her feelings on the matter meant nothing here. Planning the birthday was her only reason for being back. Whether Brinley left or stayed changed nothing about that.


Brinley's expression flickered when she saw Hannah."What are you doing here?"


Hannah let out a dry, derisive laugh. "Miss Gilbert,you've been living here so long that you almost believe you're the lady of the manor? That question should be coming from me-Vincent's actual wvife."
###Chapter 11 Find Out Who Owns ThisJacket
Something hard flickered in Brinley's eyes, but the moment she noticed Vincent drawing near, a wounded expression replaced it. "Hannah, I was just asking. I didn't mean anything by it."


Hannah stepped forward, her tone bright with sarcasm."Oh, I was just giving you a heads-up.Nothing more."


Sharp-tongued and unbothered, Hannah left Brinley no room to fight back.


Nerves got the better of Brinley as she balled her hands into fists. But glancing at Vincent, she pasted on a sugary smile and slipped her arm through his."Vincent, you must be exhausted."


An uninterested glance from Hannah caught the scene, but she kept walking, ignoring them both.
Vincent gently untangled himself from Brinley's grasp. "GGo on ahead. I have something to discuss with Derek."



For a split second, Brinley hesitated. "Alright," she said, disappointment coloring her features as she turned away.


Right then, Derek hurried over from the car, holding a suit jacket. "Mr. Jones,your wife accidentally left this behind."



Shadowed eyes fixed on the jacket, Vincent's voice dropped. "Check who owns this jacket."


Uncertainty crept into Derek's question. "Alright.Should I return it to Mrs. Jones?"


"Get rid of it," Vincent said,his tone ice-cold.


Derek didn't dare argue. He nodded and left without another word.



Inside, the dining room was already set with dishes that smelled freshly made.
At the sound of approaching footsteps, Danica spun around with a bright greeting-her smile freezing instantly as she spotted Hannah. "Why are you back?" The warmth vanished.


A raised eyebrow from Hannah made her intentions clear."Am I not allowed to return here? Until I hand over the divorce papers, I still belong to this family.So I'll come and go as I please."


A shadow clouded Danica's face. "You've split from Vincent already. If you had any sense, you'd keep your distance. Why stick around-what's your real motive?"


Hannah let a brittle laugh fill the room."Oh, I see.The real problem is me ruining the happy little scene between Brinley and Vincent."


For once, Danica stayed silent, which said enough.


An edge crept into Hannah's smile. "Isn't it funny?You're so eager to see me out, but you haven't even handed over the properties you promised. Is this how you make good on your deals, Danica?"
"You keep acting like I'm dragging my feet. I told you it wasn't going to happen overnight. I gave you my word.What, do you really believe I'd hesitate over a handful of houses?" Danica's voice shot up as she got emotional.


At that moment, Vincent entered and caught the last part of the exchange. A frown creased his brow."What houses?"



Not bothering to spare him a look, Hannah simply lifted an eyebrow at Danica, a hint of amusement in her eyes. "Yeah, what houses?"


Covering quickly, Danica waved off the question."Oh, it's nothing at all. Hannah was just interested in one of my properties. Isn't that right, Hannah?"


A sharp glance from Danica served as a silent warning.





Shrugging, Hannah gave her a cold, mocking smile."Whatever you say."


Choosing the seat beside Hannah, Vincent loosened his collar and settled in. "Mom's properties aren't half bad. Are you planning on living in one, or is this about investment?"


Hannah shot him a suspicious look. "Why does it matter to you?"


With a businesslike tone, Vincent replied, "I could help you make the right call." Years of experience had taught him how to spot a good deal. Every part of the Jones Group had flourished under his watch.


Hannah paused for a second and then said nothing.


While the conversation continued, Brinley remained off to the side, ignored and out of place. Fingernails biting into her palm, she kept her features smooth and pleasant. "Mrs. Jones, now that Vincent's back,why don't we all eat?"


Jumping in to smooth things over, Danica added,"Brinley put together the whole meal and wouldn't touch a single dish until you arrived, Vincent.She's always so  With a small, demure smile, Brinley ducked her head."Mrs. Jones, you give me too much credit."


Brinley ladled soup into Vincent's bowl and placed it in front of him.



Looking around the table, Hannah asked, "Where's Sharon? Isn't she eating with us?"


Danica answered lightly, not missing a beat, "She's getting on in years and turned in early. Had some porridge and went straight to bed."


While talking, Danica continued to pile food onto Vincent's plate. "Here, have some more."


Watching Vincent closely, Brinley waited for his reaction. "Vincent, do you like the meal? I tried a new recipe."


Without much interest, Vincent barely touched the food before putting down his utensils. The soup went untouched. "There's no need for you to cook or serve me," he said, his voice indifferent. "Wehave plenty of staff for that."considerate."
###Chapter 12 Played As The Assistant
Danica totally misinterpreted Vincent's polite refusal as concern for Brinley. With a nudge and a cheerful grin, she turned to Brinley. "See? What did I say?Vincent only wants to make sure you aren't wearing yourself out."


This drew a bright smile from Brinley. "It's no burden at all, Vincent. I actually like doing these little things for you."


Meanwhile, Hannah toyed with her fork, her appetite gone in an instant.


Her reaction didn't escape Vincent's notice, but just as he was about to speak up, Danica beat him to it."Sharon's 70th birthday is coming up fast. I've decided to let Brinley take the lead with the planning this time." Her tone sparkled, as if she had just shared a fabulous surprise.



In Danica's mind, Hannah and Vincent's upcoming divorce meant Sharon's birthday planning was the perfect chance to let Brinley shine. A flawless event would give her an excuse to announce Brinley as her chosen daughter-in-law and set everything in motion for the future.


Confidence radiated from Brinley as she nodded."Thank you, Mrs. Jones. I'll make sure Sharon has a birthday she'll remember for the rest of her life."


Turning to Vincent, Hannah's face was shadowed."Well, since you've already picked somneone else for the job, why bother asking me?"


"I didn't know until just now," Vincent said, frowning slightly. He turned to Danica. "Hannah's handled this every year,and-"


Cutting him off with a dismissive wave, Danica pushed her point. "She's organized it enough times.Skipping one party isn't the end of the world. We need a change."


Calm and steady, Vincent replied, "It's still Grandma's birthday. Her granddaughter-in-law should handle it."


Danica held her position. "Brinley practically grew up under Sharon's roof. She knows what the family likes.Why shouldn't she take care of the birthday planning?"


With a soft, self-effacing smile, Brinley looked down."Mrs. Jones, perhaps we should let Hannah handle it.I probably am overstepping. After all, I'm just an outsider. Hannah's much better suited for this."


It was a calculated retreat to win support, and Brinley played her part to perfection. Hannah saw through her charade in an instant.


A single glance from Hannah carried all the cold contempt she felt. "That's correct. You're just an outsider, and I am more suited."


With her lips pressed tight, Brinley lowered her eyes,pretending to be wounded.


Danica wasted no time jumping to Brinley's defense."Vincent, can't you see how upset Brinley is?"
A note of regret crept into Vincent voice."That's not what I meant at all."
Never one to give up,Danica pressed her case "Let's compromise. Brinley wvill lead the planning,and Hannah can step in as her assistant.Does that sound fair?"
"That sounds perfect," Brinley chimed in immediately. "I'd love to learn from Hannah."
A sharp laugh escaped Hannah. "Absolutely not.Why should I take orders from her?"
Softening her voice, Brinley tried to appeal to the room."I've been abroad all these  years.Sharon's  always been kind to me. Now that  I'm back,  I just want to do something nice for her. Hannah,it's just a  celebration-does it really matter who's running it?"
No sign of yielding appeared on Hannah's face."Either I take charge or I'm out.if you want the spotlight,then own it. If not, don't bother

Eyes wet and pleading, Brinley turned to Vincent.allI want is to make Sharon happy. Could you please talk to Hannah for my sak<e?"


Several long seconds passed before Vincent gave his verdict."We'll go with Mom's suggestion."


Hannah snapped,"Excuse me?"


Unruffled, Vincent explained, "This may be Brinley's only opportunity. You'll have more chances in the future."


Expression dull, Hannah responded, "I am not on board." They would soon be divorced, and she didn't have any more chances. By then, as an ex-wife, her place in this household would be next to nothing.


Vincent closed the discussion. "It's settled."
###Chapter 13 Still Have The Nerve ToCling To Him
"If you refuse to play as the assistant, then that's the end of it," Vincent said, his tone firm. "Brinley will take charge of the entre birthday banquet on her own."



Excitement flickered in Brinley's gaze, a spark she barely managed to hide.


A cold laugh tumbled from Hannah's lips. "Vincent,you're the one who'd dragged me all the way back.And now this? Am I supposed to just let you walk all over me?" She regretted it-regretted letting her guard down and believing him for evena second.


With a tired sigh, Vincent pressed his fingers to his temples. "That isn't what I mean. You said no to assist Brinley, so now you don't have to."


Disbelief hovered around Hannah as she let out a scoff. Truthfully, she didn't trust Brinley with the entire banquet. Something in her gut warned that the party could turn into a mess if Brinley managed it.Letting Sharon's birthday be ruined was out of the question.


In the end, Hannah relented. "Fine. I'll take the assistant's role."


Disappointment weighed heavily in her tone, and Vincent noticed right away. Words hovered on his lips, but Brinley was faster. "Thank you, Vincent.Everything will be perfect. Sharon will have the best celebration she's ever had-I promise."


Victory shone in Brinley's eyes. Despite Vincent's harsh tone the last time they talked alone, it was clear he was still on her side. That was all she needed to outplay Hannah.


Watching from her seat, Danica looked absolutely pleased to see her son taking Brinley's side.


Hannah,choosing silence, left the table and headed straight to her room. After this exchange, she'd lost her appetite. Locked away in her room, a tidal wave of feelings swept through her, every one of them tracing back to Vincent.


A sudden knock broke the silence. One of the housekeepers stood outside her door. "Mrs. Jones,Mr. Jones noticed you barely touched your food and asked me to bring you some dessert."


"Just set it down," Hannah replied, not bothering to glance up. This was so typical of Vincent-hurting her first and patching things up later with shallow gestures. As if a sweet treat could erase the sting of his actions. As if she could be bought with a few kind crumbs. Honestly, maybe she'd given in too many times. The more he disappointed her, the more she found herself growing numb. Only the occasional,hollow ache in her chest reminded her that she could still feel at all.



Meanwhile, downstairs, Danica couldn't hide her displeasure at Hannah's habit of holing up in her room after dinner, avoiding any household responsibilities.
Predictably, Brinley leapt at the chance of playing as a messenger and volunteered to fetch Hannah.


As fate would have it, Hannah emerged from her room for a glass of water just as Brinley made her way up the stairs.


Without a word, Hannah passed by, her glass in tow,her expression as cold as the marble beneath her feet.


"Hannah," Brinley remarked, unwilling to let her go.


Choosing not to react, Hannah continued down the stairs, determined to ignore her.


A quick sidestep put Brinley in Hannah's path.


"What is it?" Hannah asked, irritation sharpening her words.


"I only meant to say this-I was just as surprised when Vincent defended me. You went out of your way to turn him against me, and still, nothing between him and me has shifted at all." Brinley smiled, her expression dripping with smug  satisfaction.


"Yeah, he cares a lot for you," Hannah said, her laugh empty. "Is that what you wanted to hear all along?"


Not waiting for a response, Hannah pivoted to walk away.


Once again, Brinley stepped in, blocking the stairs."Don't you find yourself pathetic? Not a single person at the dinner table stood up for you. Everyone sided with me. And yet, you still have the nerve to cling to Vincent?" Triumph sparkled in her eyes.


A chilly laugh escaped Hannah. "Pathetic or not, I'm still Vincent's legal wife."


Mockery curled Brinley's lips. "Doesn't matter.You're just a stand-in during my absence. He never loved you."


Those words stung, but Hannah met her gaze and forced a smile. "Even so, until I walk away, you'll always be the shameless mistress."


Contempt flickered in Brinley's tone. "You already know he sees you as my substitute, and you're still holding on to that title? Have you no shame,Hannah?"
With a shrug, Hannah retorted, "At least I'm not the shameless one scheming to wreck someone else's marriage."
Anger flared in Brinley's eyes. "I dare you say that again!"
Enraged, Brinley gave Hannah a violent shove,sending Hannah stumbling down the staircase.
Hannah landed hard, the water glass slipping from her grasp and exploding into shards across the tiles.An attempt to stand only made things worse. Her palm pressed into the broken glass, and pain shot through her hand like electricity.
Footsteps echoed above. In a flash, Brinley scrambled down the stairs and threw herself to the floor, clutching her arm and twisting her face into an agonized mask.
Meanwhile, Vincent had just finished a round of work in his study. The sudden commotion drew him out. At the sight of both women crumpled at the base of the stairs, his expression went from confusion to alarm."What happened here?"
 ###Chapter 14 He Didn't Notice HerInjuries

Broken glass sparkled across the polished floor,glinting in the light.


Vincent arrived at the scene in seconds, dropping to Brinley's side and helping her up without hesitation.A grimace flickered on his face as he noticed her hand, bloody and riddled wvith shards.


That moment of concern for Brinley wasn't lost on Hannah. Something heavy and cold settled deep inside her. Pushing through the pain, she pulled herself to her feet unaided.



"Can someone explain what happened?" Vincent's gaze swept to Hannah for answers.



Barely had Hannah opened her mouth when Brinley jumped in, her voice trembling, "It all happened so fast. I think Hannah pushed me, and suddenly I was falling down the stairs. The next thing I knew, she was tumbling too."


Frowning at Hannah, Vincent questioned,"Did you really push her?"


Brinley gave a weak laugh and chose her words carefully toshift Vincent's focus. "I can't say for sure why she did it. Maybe she's upset about having to assist me with the party planning, but I won't hold it against her. It's just a scratch, Vincent. Don't worry about me."



A bitter smile crossed Hannah's lips. "Bravo, Miss Gilbert. That's some impressive acting." She looked Vincent dead in the eyes, her voice cutting. "But let's get this straight. I didn't lay a finger on her. lf anyone's lying here, it's her. She pushed me down the staircase. Just look at her. She's not hurt at all."


Despair crept in, chilling Hannah to the core. She already knew where Vincent's trust lay.


Vincent showed Brinley's wounded palm to Hannah."She's not exactly fine."
But Hannah's hand was injured too-and Vincent hadn't even noticed.



Bitterness consumed Hannah. No question remained -Vincent didn't seem to care about her, his"stand-in," at all. Brinley had his full attention, as always.


A sharp, humorless laugh escaped Hannah. "You should probably rush her to the emergency room before her minor scratch heals."



Her sarcasm irritated Vincent. He was just trying to get the truth, and his tone might be sharper than intended. "Can't you just talk normally?"


Hannah answered coldly, "Don't feel like so."


Tension thickened the air, neither willing to yield.


Sniffles from Brinley filled the silence. "Why do you hate me so much, Hannah?"


Hannah frowned at the sound. Even with blood running down her own hand, somehow, she'd become the villain, baseless accusations thrown her way. Any urge to put up with it vanished. Her unharmed hand whipped up, landing a slap across Brinley's cheek with a crack that left no room for confusion.


Hannah spat, "If I wanted to hurt you, Brinley, you'd know it. I don't waste time with games."


Another slap was ready, but Vincent caught her wrist mid-swing. "That's enough, Hannah."


Hannah yanked her arm away and let out a bitter laugh. "So, you couldn't bear to see her hurt by me,right? And you're still taking her side, Vincent? I'm your wife."


Vincent's expression tightened as his brow drew together. "Being my wife doesn't give you the right to bully others like this."


"You think I'm bullying her?" Hannah scoffed,a bitter laugh about to escape but failed.


Brinley quickly stepped in to ease the tension just to make her look good. "Vincent, please don't be upset.Hannah probably just lost control for a moment. Take me to get my hand treated, okay?"


Vincent's sharp features softened a bit."Alright."


Brinley even glanced over at Hannah, sticking to her considerate persona. "Maybe Hannah needs a hospital trip too?"


Vincent dismissed the idea immediately. "NNo.Let her cool off for a bit."


All the noise soon drew Danica over, her voice sharp with irritation. "What is it this time, Hannah? All this fuss just because you didn't want to do a little housework?"


Her gaze shifted, shock freezing her expression as she spotted Brinley's bleeding hand. "Oh my! Brinley,your hand!"


With a gentle smile, Brinley made a feigned attempt to downplay it. "Really, it's nothing."


"Nothing? That could leave a scar! Vincent, what are you waiting for? Get her to the emergency room-now!"
Vincent didn't hesitate. "We're leaving."


Brinley reached out, expecting Vincent to carry her.


But Vincent simply brushed past her and asked lightly, "Did you hurt your leg?"


"N-no, just my hand..." Quick to follow, Brinley trailed after him, shooting a smug, victorious glance at Hannah before disappearing.


Still rooted to the spot, Hannah felt her heart drop lower than ever. Laughter, dry and hollow, escaped her lips. Of course. First loves would always matter more than a stand-in like her. Barely above a whisper,she spoke to the empty hallway. "Vincent, we're finished.Totally."

###Chapter 15 You Almost Pushed Her
Over The Edge

As soon as Vincent and Brinley headed out for the hospital, Danica marched straight over to Hannah,her anger barely contained.
"You actually wanted Brinley gone, didn't you?"Danica questioned, shoving her finger closeto Hannah's face. "I can't believe it took me this long to see just how cruel you are."
Hannah didn't bother to offer any defense. "That figures. People from your family never bother to think before acting or throwing accusations."
Turning her back, Hannah made her way upstairs to get her phone.
Danica's attention was finally drawn to the steady stream of blood running down Hannah's right hand.
"Your hand is bleeding that badly, and you're just going to ignore it? You really think pulling a stunt like this will make Vincent care about you more?" Danica yelled up the stairs.


There was no reply from Hannah. She climbed each step slowly, as if she couldn't hear a word.


Her vision was a little hazy as the earlier scene replayed in her mind. Vincent brought every single word Brinley had uttered without a hint of doubt while dismissing her explanation outright. They had been together for five years as husband and wife.Yet, that still meant nothing compared to a single tear from his first love. What was the point of everything she'd done over the years? All of it just felt like a cruel joke.



Hannah pulled out her phone and called Rena, asking her for a ride to the hospital.


Meanwhile, on the journey to the hospital, Vincent sat up front beside the driver. Brinley was seated in the back.



A deep frown stayed etched on Vincent's face, and the tension refused to leave his brow. Hannah's stubborn face kept flashing through his mind,refusing to fade. He spoke in a clipped tone to Derek."Take us to the hospital. After that, go back and get Hannah. Make sure she's treated."



"Understood," Derek replied.


Brinley's gaze darted toward Vincent as she leaned a bit closer. "Vincent, I'm sure Hannah is alright. Try not to worry."


"Hope so," he replied curtly.


Brinley wanted to say more, but Vincent clearly wasn't in the mood for conversation. He answered her enthusiasm with short, blunt replies.


Once at the hospital, Brinley's tests showed no alarming issues. The only concern was the cuts on her hand from the shattered glass.



While her hand was being treated, she kept trying to lean into Vincent for comfort, but he always managed to shift away from her touch. After a while, he made an excuse to leave and walked out into the corridor.


Vincent stood alone in the hallway, still piecing his thoughts together, when his phone buzzed. Derek was calling. "Mr. Jones, Miss Brown has already taken your wife to the hospital."


"Alright," Vincent replied.


"Actually..." Derek hesitated, unsure whether to speak up.



Vincent's reply was cold. "Is there something else?"


"I saw blood all over the staircase, and it seems to be your wife's," Derek finally said, hesitating no more.Even though Brinley seemed to be the one Vincent favored these days, he still believed Vincent couldn't just turn his back on his wife.


A tightness formed in Vincent's throat. "Do you know which hospital she's in?"


"P'Il check right-"


Suddenly,someone rushed past Vincent. He glanced up and saw it was Rena.


"There's no need." Vincent ended the call and quickly caught up to Rena. "Tell me where Hannah is."


Rena spun around to face him, her anger flaring instantly. "You have some nerve showing concern now. I should be the one demanding answers-what exactly did you do to Hannah?" Her words came out shaky with rage. "Vincent, you made a promise to look after Hannah. And nowN look at her. You almost pushed her over the edge!"



Earlier, once rushing over to the Jones family estate,Rena had been greeted by the sight of Hannah slumping near the gates. There was no life in Hannah's eyes, and her face had turned ashen,as if the world had broken her.


To Rena, Hannah had looked like she was hanging on by a thread. However, even in that state, Hannah had forced a faint smile and insisted she was alright. But how could she possibly be fine?
Turning away, Rena made it clear she did not want to say another word to Vincent.


Vincent's expression grew grim. "What do you mean by that? Where is she right now?"
###Chapter 16 Stayed In Her Ward
Mockery laced every word as Rena replied,,SO the famous CEO of the Jones Group suddenly can't understand simple words? Now you're worried about Hannah? Too late. Why don't you just return and look after your darling childhood love?"


After delivering that jab, Rena headed toward Hannah's hospital room.


Vincent trailed right behind her despite her attempt to shake him off.


Once Rena entered Hannah's ward, Vincent stepped forward from behind Rena and approached Hannah's bedside.


A shrug accompanied Rena's words. "Sorry, Hannah.Couldn't lose him."


A blank look settled on Hannah's face while she said indifferently, "Mr. Jones, what do you want from me now? Demanding me to pay your mistress's hospital expenses?"



"Can't we have a normal conversation?" Vincent's gaze shifted to Hannah's right hand, now wrapped in white gauze. He distinctly remembered it had been fine earlier. "What did the doctor say?"


Her reply was flat and cold. "That doesn't concern you." Every bit of pain came rushing back as she thought about how the glass shard-almost as big as her thumb-had been pulled from her hand. Enduring that made her believe she could face anything.


Vincent took a step forward and sat beside her bed."What really happened back there?"


"It doesn't matter anymore," Hannah said, her voice devoid of emotion.



Vincent added, "I just wanted to know the truth."


Instead of answering, Hannah closed her eyes,shutting him down completely. Aside from the glance she had cast his way the moment he entered, she hadn't spared him a look since. She was truly mad at him.


At that moment, a nurse stepped inside. "Ma'am,how is your head? Does the concussion still trouble you?"


Hannah shook her head and answered, "I'm much better.Thank you."


The nurse replaced her IV bag with practiced hands."You'll need these fluids through the night. It's best if someone stays here with you."


Vincent gave a courteous reply. "I understand. Thank you."


Rena waved him off. "Go keep your precious Brinley company. I'll stay here and look after Hannah."


In a steady voice, Vincent replied, "I'll stay. There's no need for you to trouble yourself, Miss Brown."


Rena's eyes narrowed. "Really? I was the one who'd picked Hannah up and rushed her to the hospital.Where were you while she needed you the most?"
Vincent had no answer for that.



Rena looked like she wanted to continue, but Vincent pressed his finger to his lips and softly said, "She's asleep now."


A heavy silence filled the room.


Not long after, Rena's phone rang, and she excused herself. Vincent nodded, walking her to the door.


At the same time, Brinley had been looking everywhere for Vincent after her hand was bandaged. She'd already asked Derek and learned Vincent had not gone home. He was still somewhere in the hospital.


All at once, Brinley caught sight of Vincent leaving a ward with a woman right behind. As soon as that woman walked away, Vincent turned around and reentered the ward.


Brinley made her way over, only to discover Hannah lying in the hospital bed. A mix of anger and disbelief twisted her features. That annoying Hannah really was everywhere.


Burning with irritation, Brinley headed back to the ER and complained about feeling dizzy. A nurse guided her to a ward to rest. She even requested an IV, so the nurse hooked her up to a glucose drip.



...


Vincent never left Hannah's side the entire night.


By the time morning arrived and Hannah finally woke up, her eyes immediately landed on him. He was sitting by her bed, head leaned back and eyes shut as if he had fallen asleep. Even while slumped in the chair, he still managed to look dignified and in control.


As soon as he sensed her gaze, he opened his eyes and spoke in a low voice. "Staring at me first thing after waking up?"


She looked at him and asked, "You weren't really sleeping?"


He replied, "No. I just had my eyes closed for a bit."
The way he said it left her unsure-had he been awake the whole night, or had he only managed to close his eyes just now? But she didn't care enough to find out.



Right then, her phone vibrated with a new message from Brinley. "Believe it or not-just one text from me and Vincent will come running to me."
###Chapter 17 The Patient In Bed 32 lsMy Wife

Hannah didn't bother to reply to Brinley's message.

A little later, Vincent checked his phone and spoke to Hannah. "I need to leave for a bit. The last IV should be finished in about thirty minutes."


Hannah answered with a simple, "Okay." Not once did she look up, her attention fixed on her phone.Just as she had predicted, a single message from Brinley was all it took for Vincent to walk out the door.


Pretending that it did not hurt would be a lie.Countless times before, she had called him, only to be told he was too busy. Always too busy to spare time for her. When it came to his first love,though,he dropped everything without hesitation.


A wave of heartache swept over Hannah, but she swiftly pushed it aside and opened up her company's analytics dashboard. It became clear that the steady decline of her business was not only because their products lacked fresh ideas. Problems with staff played a major part, too. Restructuring the team had to come first.



While she was sorting through this, a bouquet came into view. She lifted her gaze and found Felix standing there, holding the flowers.


"Rena mentioned you were in the hospital. Are you feeling better?" he asked.


She answered softly, "I'm fine."


As luck would have it, there were plenty of things she wanted to discuss with him.


Felix set up his laptop, and both of them immediately shifted into work mode.







Elsewhere, inside Brinley's room, Vincent had just taken a seat when a nurse entered to remove the IV.
A suspicious look crossed the nurse's face as she recognized him. "Aren't you the one who stayed all night with the patient in bed thirty-two? What are you doing here?"


She let her gaze flick from Brinley to Vincent. She looked at him like he was some kind of real-life Casanova. A sharp click of her tongue showed exactly what she thought.


Vincent kept his voice level. "The patient in bed 32 is my wife." He pointed toward Brinley. "This is just an acquaintance."


The nurse's whole demeanor changed right away."Oh, that clears things up. Yeah, I could tell you weren't that kind of man. All night, you've stayed with your wife and checked on her. I noticed it all.You seemed so loyal, not like someone sneaking around."



Brinley's stomach churned. She had refused to look for Vincent last night, assuming he would come to her on his own. He never did, not even bothering to text her. It was only after she messaged him, saying  her condition had worsened and she needed IV fluids, that he finally came by.


Brinley could tell Vincent harbored feelings toward Hannah.And she hated it.


As soon as the nurse left, Vincent looked at Brinley and spoke in a measured tone. "I already know what happened last night.Hannah didn't push you."


Though his voice stayed calm, the coldness in his eyes made Brinley's skin prickle. Color drained from her cheeks. "Vincent, was that what Hannah told you? Did she say I pushed her? Don't believe just what she says-she's twisting everything!"


Vincent responded, his tone cool and even, "Then tell me your version.What really happened?"


Brinley insisted, her voice growing shrill, "She pushed me first! Then, she pretended to fall after me..."



Vincent cut her off. "Brinley." He stood up,disappointment etched on his face. "Hannah never accused you of anything. I checked with the doctor about your injuries myself."


For a moment, Brinley could not move. Did Vincent already know the truth? No. She couldn't admit her own doing. That would ruin her image in his heart.Forcing herself to tear up, she choked out, "Vincent,do you really think I'm lying? What if Hannah bribed the doctor to frame me-made it look like I wasn't hurt when I actually was?"


Vincent remarked coldly, "She did not even know which room you were in. How could she possibly set you up?"
###Chapter 18 Caught Her With AnotherMan Again
Upon hearing Vincent's words, Brinley fell silent.


Vincent added, "You should feel lucky that Hannah is alright. If things had turned out worse, you wouldn't be getting off so easily."


Ever since Brinley's father, Charles Gilbert, passed away because of Vincent, Vincent had gone out of his way to treat Brinley kindly-she was Charles's only child.


Now with the tension rising, Brinley had no choice but to feign discomfort, pressing her hand to her chest and claiming she was having heart palpitations.Then, she closed her eyes, pretending to have passed out. Facing the truth, especially coming from Vincent, was more than she could stand.


Without hesitating, Vincent called for a doctor before stepping out. Brinley needed time to reflect.






Meanwhile, in Hannah's room, Felix noticed her IV was almost empty and pressed the button to call a nurse.



A nurse entered and stopped short when she spotted a strange man sitting next to Hannah. She gazed at Hannah. "And who might this gentleman be? Your husband is still over there with his acquaintance."


Hannah knew Vincent was with Brinley. A calm reply came from her. "He's actually my ex-husband."


Surprise flickered in the nurse's eyes. "Wait-so everything here is that complicated?"


Hannah answered with a quiet smile, not bothering to explain.


Once the IV was out, Felix put away his laptop and offered to drive Hannah home.



But they'd been deep in discussion, and Hannah wasn't ready to return home just yet. A new idea crossed her mind. "How about we continue talking at a café instead?"



Felix grinned. "That works for me. But you just spent the night on fluids-are you even allowed to have coffee?"


"| feel brand new now. That IV must have been some kind of miracle cure."


Felix could not help but laugh at her dry humor.Together, the two left the hospital and headed to the cafe.


Meanwhile, Vincent walked back into Hannah's hospital room, only to discover the bed was empty.He started asking staff about her whereabouts and soon heard that she had left with another man right after her IV finished. A stormy look crossed his face.His fingers traced the wedding band on his hand as his mind drifted.



Later, when Derek came to pick Vincent up, Vincent was alone. Neither Brinley nor Hannah joined him.
 Vincent's foul mood was impossible to miss.


That afternoon, Vincent barked at several team members over a contract issue, putting everyone at the office on edge. No one knew what had set him off.



Several staff members slipped out to a nearby caféto complain. None of them expected to run right into Vincent's "lover," Hannah. To make things even more interesting, they saw her with another man,something they could gossip about for days.


A few quick photos were snapped before they quickly fled the scene. The office group chat was soon buzzing with updates.


"Looks like the boss's lover has moved on to someone new!"


"Wait, what? So he's the one who got dumped?"


Clive Monroe, the head secretary, jumped in with confidence. "No chance. Everyone knows Hannah's the one who got tossed aside. His first love came back,that's the story."


Clive had recently talked with Brinley. From what he had noticed, Vincent spared no effort in treating her well. Only a few days ago, Vincent had instructed him to pick out a purple gemstone necklace. He made sure to send the photo of it to Brinley right away. It came as no surprise when she wore it the very next day. Clearly, he had chosen the right person to suck up to.


If Clive had to make a prediction, he would say Brinley would be joining the company soon, followed by some big announcement about their engagement.It was plain to see-Vincent intended to marry Brinley.


Lost in his own theories, Clive failed to notice Vincent had walked up right behind him.


In his distraction, Clive had forgotten to deliver the revised contract documents. Even though Vincent had called and texted, Clive hadn't answered once,prompting Vincent to come and check the situation. Now, as Vincent glanced at the group chat history on Clive's phone, he spotted a photo of Hannah sitting with another man. His tone dropped to a low, cold register. "Where was this taken?"


Clive jumped, startled. "It was at Chance Café."


Without showing much emotion, Vincent smoothed the cuff of his shirt. "If the contract revision isn't finished before the day ends, everyone loses their monthly bonus."


Groans spread across the office.


When Vincent got into the car, he instructed Derek,"Drive to Chance Café."



At the same time, Clive hesitated and then sent Brinley a heads-up.
###Chapter 19 My Wife Doesn't Need ToWork
"You want coffee? No need for you to get it yourself -I can go. Still want your usual iced Americano?"Derek asked, always tuned in to Vincent's preferences.


"No coffee today," Vincent muttered, eyes fixed on the view outside. His mood was anything but calm."Just drive to Chance Café."



"Understood."


About five minutes later, they pulled up to Chance Café. Vincent wasted no time striding inside. Inside,Hannah had her hair tied up, showing off the smooth lines of her face. Her features were soft, her energy unmistakable. Her eyes had a doe-like brightness,and she nibbled on her lip when she thought. The man seated next to her gazed at her with a soft expression.
Vincent's jaw clenched. As a man, he knew exactly what that look meant-that guy harbored feelings toward Hannah. And to make matters worse, it was the same man who had taken Hannah home the other night. Twice now. She had been with that guy twice.



Meanwhile, at the table, Hannah and Felix were locked in animated discussion.



Hannah had just uncovered a key issue-Nova Tech's procurement manager had been pocketing kickbacks for years, which explained why their materials had been so substandard.



"The procurement manager needs to be removed,"Hannah said without hesitation.



Felix hesitated. "He's been part of the company for a long time."


"He'll get a proper severance," she said firmly. "Or he can be reassigned to a non-critical role."


Felix leaned forward slightly.
thinking of returning to the company?"


"In a day or two," she responded.


He gently slid a plate of pastries in her direction. "Eat something first."


"I'm not that hungry," Hannah said, resting her chin on one hand while scanning the computer screen."Once we streamline the team,we can finally focus on developing new products."


Felix nodded in agreement. "Exactly. With a clear brand identity, we'll have no trouble connecting with the female market."



Feeling encouraged, Hannah reached out and grabbed a pastry. A small dollop of whipped cream ended up on the tip of her nose.


Felix thought the sight was irresistibly cute. He picked up a napkin and paused, debating whether to hand it to her or wipe it himself. After a moment, he chose the bolder option and reached out.


Before he could touch her, a tall figure appeared,
blocking his hand midair.

Hannah's eyes widened when she looked up and saw Vincent standing there. "What are you doing here?"


Vincent replied curtly, "Stopped by to grab coffee.Saw you by coincidence."


Yeah, right. Hannah knew better-since when had Vincent ever fetched his own coffee?


Vincent pulled out a chair and sat between the two of them. He turned to Hannah. "Second time I've met this gentleman, and still no introduction?"

"Felix Wade," Hannah said flatly. "Vincent Jones."


The two men gave each other a nod, both keeping their expressions carefully neutral.


"So, what line of work are you in, Mr. Wade?" Vincent asked with a laid-back tone.


"I run a small business," Felix replied, his voice steady.


Vincent leaned in slightly. "How small are we talking?"


Felix brought his cup to his lips. "Around twenty employees."


A slight arch of Vincent's brow followed. "That's definitely on the small side."


Hannah shot Vincent a look. "Are you doing a background check? What's with all the questions?"

"Just chatting. But if it bothers you, I'll stop," Vincent replied smoothly, flashing a calm smile at her.what were you two talking about?"


Felix answered before she could, "Nothing serious.Just some work stuff."


"Work? Since when does my wife need to work?"Vincent smirked.


Vincent kept his tone light, but each word struck Hannah like a slap-sharp and dismissive. So, that was what he really thought of her. After five years of marriage and everything she had given up just to be a housewife behind closed doors for him, this was all she got from him-mockery dressed as casual conversation.


A flicker of anger crossed Felix's face. "Sounds like being married to you isn't exactly the dream people assume it is."



Vincent's brow tightened at the remark.


Without raising his voice, Felix added, "Hannah, you made the wise choice of divorcing him."
###Chapter 20 Stop Thinking She's UpFor Grabs
Vincent's brows drew together as he looked at Hannah."You told him we're divorced?"


Hannah lowered her gaze, fighting to swallow the bitterness rising in her throat. "I wasn't wrong." They were already divorced. He'd signed the divorce agreement without realizing it. It just hadn't been made public yet. In twenty days, the news would be official.


Unaware that the divorce was real, Vincent scowled.Had Hannah really repeated her angry words from one of their arguments to another man? No wonder Felix had acted so forward. He probably thought she was single.


"Oh really? And why would you say something like that? Is it because you actually like him?" Vincent questioned, a sneer tugging at his mouth. His entire expression turned cold and threatening.


"What nonsense are you talking about?" Hannah shot up from her seat, shooting Vincent a glare. As a few heads turned their way, she quickly lowered her voice."Have you lost it?"


"I should be the one asking that," Vincent snapped back, tapping his fingers on the table with growing frustration. "Did you forget you're still a married woman?"


A bitter laugh slipped from Hannah's mouth. "That's rich, coming from you. You don't exactly behave like a married man."


Vincent raised his hand and held it up. The gold band on his ring finger gleamed under the café light."How don't I? I wear this every single day." It was the ring she had picked for him and slipped onto his finger.


Turning her head away from him, Hannah retorted,"So what? There's still a line of women throwing themselves at you."
 Vincent's brow tightened. "I've said no to every single one of them."


"No, you didn't turn Brinley away," she muttered inwardly instead of saying them out loud. Her breathing grew uneven as she got emotional. A sudden wave of dizziness hit, and her legs gave way beneath her.


Vincent moved without hesitation, wrapping an arm around her waist to steady her.


Felix reached out too, but his reaction came just a second too late. He awkwardly pulled his hand back.


Vincent placed his hand gently against her forehead."Still lightheaded?"


Hannah batted his hand away. "I don't need your feigned concern."


Vincent's expression clouded over. Without a word,he firmly pressed her back into the chair. "If you're not fully recovered, then stop running around like you are."
"You really want me to get better?" she retorted."Then go back to your company.Do it now."


Vincent swallowed hard before replying, "There's no hurry."


Vincent looked ready to say more, but Felix quietly stepped in and handed Hannah a cup of water."Here.Drink this."



"Thank you." A quiet smile passed between them-a gentle, effortless exchange between two people who looked like they belonged in the same frame.


Vincent's eyes narrowed. His voice came out sharp and biting. "Mr. Wade, do you always go out of your way for women who belong to someone else?"


Felix didn't flinch. "Not really. But I doubt l've ever gone as far as you have with someone who isn't your wife." He hadn't let go of what he'd seen just days ago.


Vincent gave a dry laugh and stood. The smile vanished as quickly as it came, replaced by a cold,
 unreadable stare. He wasn't in the mood to waste words with Felix. He reached down, took hold of Hannah's wrist, and said, "We're going back to the hospital."


"No." She tried to wriggle her hand free.


"Yes." He tightened his grip on her.


"| said no."


They stood facing each other, neither one backing down.


Without warning, Vincent scooped her into his arms.


Heads turned across the café as every eye locked on them.


Hannah squirmed, fists landing against his chest with rapid,frustrated blows.


Her resistance only drew more attention from the room.


Vincent leaned in, his breath brushing her ear."Keep this up, and I won't hesitate to kiss you right here."
‘Hannah fell silent. That was exactly the kind of thing he'd follow through on without a second thought.She jerked her face to the side and stopped resisting.


Vincent carried her to the car without another word.Felix walked behind them, handing over her bag once she was inside.



"Felix, let's keep in touch," she said, her voice low.


"Of course. Always," he replied. He gave a small wave and started to leave.



But Vincent stopped him. "Thanks," he said, referring to the help with her things. Then, his tone turned sharp. "And stop thinking she's up for grabs. I'm not divorcing her. Not now, not ever."
###Chapter 21 Just A Normal FightBetween Husband And Wife

Felix leaned back, arms folded with a glint of defiance in his eyes. "Let me tell you something.When a woman gets hurt, she rarely looks back.Besides, Hannah told me herself she's divorced.I trust her word."



A shadow crossed Vincent's features. He touched his wedding ring, twisting it absentmindedly, before letting out a short, humorless laugh. "Just a normal fight between husband and wife. Couples argue all the time.How could you fall for her angry words?"


"Sometimes, a small argument is just the start. You'd be surprised how quickly things turn permanent,"Felix retorted, a smirk tugging at his mouth.


Vincent fixed him with an indifferent stare. "That's never happening." Without another glance,he swung open the car door and slid into the backseat.
Inside the Bentley, Hannah sat perfectly still,feigning asleep as the world outside faded to murmurs. Every word had slipped through the car window and settled in her chest. Was that really all Vincent thought this was? Just another argument? Did he honestly think their divorce was somne empty threat? Clearly, every sign of their failing marriage had escaped him. If he cared at all, he would have noticed the cracks that had split their lives apart ages ago-fractures that no amount of time could fix. There was no path left for them but divorce.



Vincent glanced over at Hannah, her forehead pressed to the window, and inched a bit closer.He tried to sound casual. "So, how do you know Felix?"


Hannah kept her eyes shut, refusing to answer.


Irritation crept into his voice. "Hannah. I'm speaking to you."


She kept her eyes closed. "All this talking is giving me a headache."


For good measure, she added, "And I don't need any more noise right now."


No part of her wanted to engage. Letting her head drift toward the window, she tried to edge herself as far from him as possible.



A muscle worked in Vincent's jaw, his patience wearing thin as his eyes darkened.


Nobody spoke. An uneasy hush filled the car, thick enough to suffocate. From the driver's seat, Derek stared straight ahead, careful not to breathe too loudly.


Their arrival at the hospital was brisk and silent.Vincent wasted no time getting Hannah checked in with one of the top neurologists, suspecting that her dizziness might be due to a mild concussion.


Testing finished quickly, and the doctor pronounced her mostly fine. He suggested she rest and ordered a round of IV fluids.



Long after the doctor's footsteps faded, Vincent remained rooted by her side.
 A casual tone colored her question. "You don't have anything to take care of at work?"


"I'll leave once your IV finishes," Vincent replied, his attention locked onto his phone as he scrolled through the latest contract his secretary had sent.


Shoulders lifting in a shrug, she replied, "Do as you please."


A flicker of curiosity made her steal a look at him.Every line of his face looked perfectly carved,and that small mole under his left eye caught the light.Someone once told her a mark like that belonged to someone with a cold soul. Focused as ever, he read his phone, the overhead lights framing his silhouette.


"You've been watching me," Vincent remarked, lifting a brow.


"If you noticed, you must have been watching me too," she shot back.


Vincent's eyes lit up. Just for a moment, it felt like old times-back when Hannah had been chasing after With a chuckle, he leaned in, lowering his voice."No matter what you say, I could feel your eyes on me for a while."


There was something tender in his eyes as he gazed at her.



Between them, the mood shifted, drawing them together in a silent, magnetic pull.


His crisp cologne floated between them, and she instinctively turned her face away from him. No matter how he looked at her, shestill felt like he was seeing someone else through her.


Out of nowhere, the sharp ring of his phone broke the silence.


At first, Vincent let it ring, pretending not to hear.Hannah nudged him lightly. "You should answer that."


His voice came out low. "Let it ring." He leaned closer, hoping to kiss her, as if the world outside could wait.  Her patience ran out. "Pick up, Vincent. It could be urgent."


She couldn't stomach being kissed by him, especially after his betrayal. Her body tensed, every nerve screaming resistance.


With a heavy sigh, Vincent finally took the call. His features turned all business upon hearing whatever the other end of the line had said. "I'll be there right away," he said before ending the call without another word.


"Something's happened at work. I have to leave." He grabbed his coat, already halfway out the door.


"Alright," she replied, barely above a whisper. This wasn't new to her. She was used to it by now.


"Let Derek take you home once you're finished here."


A short nod was all she gave. "Okay."


Vincent rattled off a handful of instructions and walked off, carrying the look of someone with pressing matters waiting on him.
###Chapter 22 A Staged Assault
Brinley stretched out on the couch in a secluded room at the bar. Empty bottles covered the floor near her feet.



Across the room, two men hovered close, getting handsy with her. One of them kept stealing looks at her chest, unable to help himself.


Brinley caught him right away, took his hand,and pressed it straight against her chest. "Be bolder," she said, letting her words slur like she was completely drunk. "Just go ahead and touch me-kiss me to0.Make it look real."


The two men exchanged a lewd grin. "If you insist,we won't say no."


The bolder one went further, yanking down her top and kissing her bare chest with abandon.


Brinley threw her head back, took another long drink,
and put up a weak struggle just for show.


This staged performance had a purpose. Brinley had witnessed what had unfolded at Chance Café this morning.The moment Hannah felt dizzy, Vincent had rushed to hold her and carried her to the car himself.All Brinley could think was, why was Vincent so concerned about Hannah? She was just a stand-in,nothing else.


Refusing to accept it, Brinley had decided to find out for herself if Vincent actually cared more about Hannah than about her. So, after seeng Vincent rush Hannah to the hospital, she'd hired these two men to stage a fake assault. When everything was in place,she'd "accidentally" called Vincent's number. He had not answered right away. Once he finally picked up,she'd remarked bluntly, "Don't touch me." With that,she'd hung up for the effect.


After that, he'd kept calling her back every ten minutes. She'd ignored each call, counting them in her head. When he'd called for the twenty-first time,she'd finally picked up. Her voice shook as she spoke."Vincent... Help me... I need you."
"Tell me where you are." Vincent's tone had come out icy and urgent.
She'd whispered, "I'm at Midnight Veil.." Then, she hung up.
Right now, the two men were clearly aroused, eyes dark with intent.
With a sly smile, Brinley said, "Take your pants off.Touch me like you mean it. Kiss me everywhere.Make it look real."
Since she had put on a performance, she made sure every detail was convincing. She reached into her purse, pulled out her phone, and twisted her face into an expression of pain and terror before handing the phone to one of the men. "Press record.Film me being 'assaulted.'"
After the video finished, Brinley took a moment to watch it. It turned out exactly the way she wanted.She smirked. The climax of the show was about to arrive. She struggled away from the men, only to be shoved down again.


Meanwhile, Vincent rushed through the club,searching room by room because he still had no idea which room Brinley was in. When he finally charged into the correct room, he saw Brinley pinned down by the two men, her clothes messy, and heard her calling out his name in pain.


Vincent's face twisted with anger. Without hesitation,he kicked both men aside. He took off his jacket and wrapped it around her shoulders. "Why did you come here alone?"



Tears streaming, Brinley threw her arms around him."Vincent, you misunderstood me earlier, and I was so upset that I sought comfort here. I never meant those words... Please don't stay angry at me..."


In the dim lighting, Vincent's expression was unreadable. "Let's get you out of here."


Brinley pressed herself to his side as they walked,but he gently moved away. "I'll get someone to bring you clean clothes," he said, taking a step back.


Desperate, Brinley grabbed his arm. "Do I disgust you now?" With her face hidden behind one hand,she began to sob again.


By the time she left the bar, Brinley was wrapped in Vincent's jacket, her arm looped tightly through his.Her eyes sparkled with victory. She knew it-Vincent still cared about her.


As he looked the other way, Brinley snapped a quick photo of herself leaning into him. She scrolled through her contacts until she found Hannah's name and sent the picture right away.

###Chapter 23 He Couldn't Find Me AndWent Completely Crazy

In the quiet of her hospital room, Hannah stared at the photo on her phone-zooming in, then out, then in again. She had no idea how many times she'd done that. In the photo, Brinley leaned against Vincent, her arm looped around his, and he didn't seem intent to push her away.


Brinley's message taunted Hannah beneath the image. "One call from me and Vincent dropped you flat. How does it feel, Hannah? He always comes running for me."


A second blow landed-a screenshot of Vincent's call log with a long row of missed calls. Twenty-one,no less. Brinley twisted the knife further. "Look at this. He couldn't find me and went completely crazy."


That number jabbed through Hannah's chest,sharp as any knife. It pulled up memories she'd tried to
bury: all those times she'd dialed Vincent, over and over, only to have every call go unanswered. Not once had he bothered to call her back. So he did know how to panic. He just never did it for her. For him, she was only ever the substitute-never the real thing.


Hannah's mind flashed back to the excuse Vincent had tossed out before leaving: a work crisis, a last-minute rush back to the office. But the truth was obvious now. He'd gone straight to Brinley's side.Another lie-one more in a string that had always been for someone else. Just moments ago, he'd been laughing with her, trying to steal a kiss-until his old flame beckoned, and he vanished without a backward glance.



A cold ache pressed into Hannah's chest. In five years of marriage, she'd never been the woman who got chosen first-never his clear priority. When Danica hurled insults at her, she'd reached for Vincent's number, only to be brushed off with the claim of being swamped with work. Whenever high-society heirs and their friends mocked her for not being polished enough, she'd planned to confide in him at dinner. But he hadn't come home-she'd stayed up all night, waiting for a door that didn't open.



Hannah had ventured to Vincent's workplace, only to catch wind of the staff's harsh whispers. "She's just his mistress," they'd said, dismissing her as if she meant nothing. Those cruel words had been thrown her way nonstop until she knew them by heart.Every visit ended the same way-she had always been asked to wait in the secretary's lounge while Vincent was perpetually "in a meeting," "signing papers," or,on one occasion, flying overseas while she was left behind sulking over another fruitless trip.



There had been so many days like that-so many times she wanted to confront him but couldn't even find him. And he always had the same excuse, "I'm busy." Eventually, she'd stopped chasing after him.


Then, on the day she went in for a routine checkup,she'd caught Vincent checking in at a hotel with Brinley. When she called, he'd lied without flinching.  If she hadn't seen it with her own eyes, how many more of his so-called "busy" days would have fooled her?
Marriage to Vincent had hardened Hannah. She learned to build walls, to never let her hurt show,and -most important of all-to stop running to him for comfort when things fell apart.
Hannah shook her head and snapped out of her thoughts, taking a deep breath to steady herself.When her final IV finished dripping, she pressed the call button, let the nurse remove the needle, and walked out of the hospital on her own. Instead of asking Derek to fetch her,she hailed a taxi.
Back at the Jones estate, Vincent escorted Brinley to the guest suite on the third floor. "Take a shower and get some rest," he said, glancing at his watch. By now, Hannah's IV treatment at the hospital should be over.
"Vincent, could you stay?" Brinley's hand gripped his wrist, her gaze pleading and haunted. "I keep replaying everything that happened. I'm really  frightened."


He hesitated and then gently disengaged her grip."I'll ask my mother to come keep you company," he suggestedd, making it clear he had no intention of lingering.


Her voice trembled with longing. "We've known each other since we were children. Couldn't you stay-just for a while?"


Drawing a clear boundary,Vincent shook his head."I'm a married man," he replied, retreating a step.


"But you almost married me, didn't you?" Her words barely rose above a whisper.


Vincent met her gaze directly. "But the one Iactually married was Hannah."


He let the words hang between them before adding,"You've always understood the reason I was gentle with you. Don't mistake kindness for something more."
###Chapter 24 DDon't Do It Here


A heavy silence settled between Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent walked over to the door and said, "Get some rest." He eased the door shut behind him.

Brinley's hands curled into fists, anger simmering beneath the surface. She doubted Vincent truly felt nothing for her. Hannah could only ever be a substitute.

After Brinley sat and stewed in her thoughts, determination slowly set in. She would find a way to win Vincent back.

She hurrled through her shower, dabbed perfume on her neck and wrists, and wrapped herself in a pale pink towel before heading for Vincent's bedroom on the lower floor.

As Brinley entered the room, the sound of water told her Vincent was still in the bathroom. Not long after,he emerged, bare-chested, with damp hair and beads of water gliding down his abs. The moment he caught sight of her, he stopped in his tracks. A deep frown creased his face. He reached for a T-shirt and pulled it on without saying anything.

"You need something?" he asked flatly, fastening his watch. There was just enough time to pick Hannah up.

"Vincent," Brinley said in a gentle voice, moving a little closer, "I still love you. Can't we start over?"

His eyebrows drew together. "I don't feel the same. I thought I already told you that."

She faltered. Clearly, he still held a grudge over her decision to leave him for another country five years ago.She closed the gap between them without another word, rising onto her toes and pressing her lips to his.

Vincent wasted no time.He stepped away at once.

Right at that moment, a knock sounded at the door. A chilly voice came from the hallway."1f.you two want to have sex, maybe you should pick another room?"

Standing in the hallway was Hannah. She had originally planned to speak with Vincent's grandmother about the upcoming birthday banquet, but seeing how late it had gotten, she chose not to interrupt. Nothing could have prepared her for what greeted her when she stepped into her room. Even after convincing herself she had grown numb, the scene still managed to pierce her heart. After a brief pause, she gathered her composure.

Meanwhile, Brinley, caught off guard by Vincent's sudden movement, stumbled straight into his arms. He wasted no time in pushing her away.

A woman wrapped in only a towel. A man, still dripping from his shower.Anyone would find the situation suspicious.

Hannah decided not to ask for an explanation. "There are plenty of empty rooms upstairs on the third floor.You can use whichever you like."

Vincent stepped closer and tried to clarify. "She lost her balance. I just caught her."

"Oh," Hannah replied blandly.

Clutching her towel tightly, Brinley stepped forwardd, eyes wide as she put on an innocent act. "Hannah,please don't misunderstand. Vincent and I didn't do anything."

The words were meant for Vincent, of course-so he'd see how understanding she was. A sly smile flickered across her face, a silent challenge thrown in Hannah's direction.

The whole situation invited all kinds of assumptions.

Hannah simply turned her head away. She clearly had no intention to engage in this conversation.

Brinley didn't linger. Vincent's refusal stung, but she would never let it show. Keeping her composure, she quietly thanked him for his help that night and started walking upstairs. There was no rush. Time was on her side.

Meanwhile, back in the room, an uncomfortable silence settled between Vincent and Hannah.

Vincent opened his mouth to speak more than once, but Hannah barely responded, her gaze distant,her expression unreadable.

Only after a long stretch of quiet did Hannah finally say something, her words rough around the edges."Vincent, I've already tolerated those antics. But can you..." She paused, searching for the right words.

An uneasy pressure weighed on his chest.

"Can you not do it with Brinley here?" Her eyes dropped to the floor, and her voice sounded calm,far too calm. "I only ask that you don't make out with her in this room."
Memories flashed through Hannah's mind. They had lived here for over half a year after getting married.it was, in every sense, their shared bedroom-theirfirst true home together. Side by side, they had chosen every piece of furniture, every color, every detail. Every corner held pieces of their shared past.

He had replaced the original mattress because she'd complained it was too hard. He'd gone out of his way to find a softer one. She still remembered that night-he had made love to her not once,but three times just to be sure she liked it. A crib had even appeared beside their bed, bought in hopeful anticipation. But now,that little crib sat forgotten in the farthest corner.

During their stay in this place, even though Danica had often made things difficult for Hannah,Vincent had returned home each night and joined Hannah and his grandmother at the table.

Back then, their days had felt calm, even ordinary, but for Hannah, that peace had been the truest happiness she had ever known. In those moments, when her love for him was at its peak, every night in this room had left behind a trace of passion and intimacy. Now, she didn't want those precious memories to be tainted.

Vincent looked up at her, feeling a chill growing inside. His voice came out in a low, aching tone. "Is that how you see me?"
###Chapter 25 Throwing Him At Another Woman

"You tell me, Vincent-am I wrong?" Hannah's voice trembled with anger as she pointed at the bed. "If l hadn't walked in, would you have already had sex with Brinley right here?"
She bet Vincent understood what this room meant for both of them. After they moved out, Danica had tried over and over to change everything in this room. She had insisted on keeping it just the way it was. This space held real meaning for her. Maybe it meant something to Vincent too, but clearly not enough.
Vincent's voice turned cold. "So you're just going to accuse me without even asking what really happened? Did you not see me shove her away?"
"I saw it," Hannah replied, letting out a short,humorless laugh. "You only pushed her away because I walked in."
Vincent laughed out of anger. "How many times do l have to explain? There's nothing between me and Brinley."

"Is that so? Nothing at all?" Hannah retorted."Does 'nothing' mean taking her to a hotel? Lying on the same bed with her?"

His patience snapped. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her closer. "I took her to a hotel? Did you see it with your own eyes? Or were you hiding under the bed listening?"

With her hand pressed to his chest to create some distance, she responded sharply, "I saw it with my own eyes."

He took off his watch, his eyes fixed on her. "Then tell me-what did you see exactly? What position were we in?"

Before she could get a word out, Vincent pulled her onto the bed. He pinned her hands over her head,
because I walked in."
would have made a teasing remark. Maybe she would have leaned in and whispered something daring. He waited for a reaction from the Hannah he knew. But it didn't come.
Without warning, she shoved him back, scrambled off his lap, and said coldly, "If you're aroused, let Brinley take care of it for you."
She made for the door, but Vincent caught her wrist."There's nothing happening between me and Brinley.I've always told you, she's like a sister to me."
"Oh," Hannah replied, her voice flat.
"I'm serious. I've never even slept with her," Vincent remarked, his face set.
Hannah froze. In all his years, he'd only ever dated two women-Brinley and her. So, if he wasn't lying,that meant back when they first got together,he was - Her eyes dropped, despite herself, landing right where his arousal showed through his pants. "You handle it yourself."
Vincent pulled her closer, his voice rumbling low. "So my dear wife is just going to leave me like this?"


His eyes lingered on her lips. The tension between them curled thick and slow, like smoke in the dark.


His words stirred something inside her. Still,reason rose like a wall between them. It made no difference that he and Brinley had never slept together. Maybe he held back for being a gentleman. That did not change the fact that Brinley had always been the one he truly loved. She had only ever been the substitute.And this was something he could've told her earlier,so why was she only hearing it now? None of it mattered anymore.


"Brinley would love nothing more than to help take care of your desire." Once again, she tried to push him away, but his arms only tightened around her.


"I've spelled it out for you, and you're still throwing me at another woman?" he asked coldly.
###Chapter 26 Maybe Your Son's The Problem

"Wasn't Brinley your first love?" Hannah's words Oozed sarcasm."Isn't it just typical for a man to get excited when his first love suddenly reappears?"
"Who put the idea in your head that Brinley was ever my first love?" Vincent replied sharply.
Her lashes fluttered slightly. Skepticism crept in. If Brinley was not his first, then who could it have been? She shot him a scornful look. "Anyway, don't count on me to help you." It was obvious to her that men driven by desire could lie convincingly.
Already on edge, Vincent snapped, "With the sour look on your face, I could not be less interested."
The words left his lips, and regret crept in immediately. He tried to take it back, but Hannah was quicker. "Is that so? Then maybe stop pressing your lower half against me," she retorted, shoving him away as his grip slipped. "Honestly, you disgust me."
That was the end of it. The fight ended with both of them angry and nothing solved.
Vincent locked himself in the study, his chest heavy and tense.
Two full days went by without a word between them.
Vincent started leaving the house early and coming home late. Meanwhile, Hannah jumped right back into her role at Nova Tech. In just forty-eight hours,she'd fired the procurement manager, overhauled the organizational structure, and left the staff grumbling behind her back-calling her a flashy figurehead with no real skills, just someone riding on connections.
The gossip pages soon lit up with bold headlines about Vincent and Brinley-"Jones Group CEO Acts out for His First Love." The story dominated the entertainment news all afternoon.
That was how Hannah learned what Vincent had  really been up to after leaving her at the hospital the other day-he had rushed off to play the hero for Brinley.
Brinley kept texting Hannah photo after photo of the decorations for Sharon's upcoming birthday party.Hannah did not bother to respond.
Vincent instructed Clive to wipe the story from every entertainment site. Not long after, Derek messaged Vincent about the suit jacket-it didn't belong to Felix, and they were still working on figuring out its mysterious owner.

Vincent grunted in response and ended the call.


The next morning, almost everyone was home-Brinley was the only one missing. Sharon's eyes sparkled as she saw the family together and called everyone over for breakfast.
A fair amount of time had passed since Hannah last saw Sharon.She purred, "Sharon, I missed you." She leaned in and rested her head on Sharon's shoulder,showing real affection.
Sharon reached up and gave Hannah's nose a playfu pinch. "You sweet thing. I missed you just as much."She smoothed Hannah's hair and grinned. "Now,about the baby, how is that coming along? Will I get to hear some good news on my birthday? Nothing would make me happier than the arrival of a great-grandchild."
While speaking, Sharon turned her gaze toward Vincent,making her expectations perfectly clear.
Vincent hesitated for a moment and then replied honestly, "When things slow down at work, I'll take Hannah away on a vacation." The meaning behind his words was unmistakable.
Hannah managed a polite, well-practiced smile. A baby? She would leave Vincent's world entirely in eighteen days. Lowering her eyes, she quietly took a spoonful of porridge.
Danica, unable to keep quiet, looked Hannah up and down. "If you want my opinion, the issue probably
lies with Hannah. Five years and not a single child?That's definitely strange."

Vincent's face tightened with anger.
Danica shrugged, tossing up her hands. "Don't look at me like that. Somebody had to say it."
Hannah's grip on her spoon tightened. All those old hurts rushed back instantly. She faced Danica and spoke with steady clarity.r maybe your son's the problem."
In the past, Hannah had done everything she could to win Danica's approval, all for Vincent's sake. Yet no matter her efforts, it had never been good enough. Danica never accepted her. But now, none of that mattered anymore.
A muscle jumped in Vincent's jaw.
Danica stared at Hannah, caught off guard."What's that supposed to mean?"

"I went for a full checkup. The doctor said | was perfectly healthy. So, the childless issue is not on mell Hannah said, her tone cool. She cast a glance at Vincent. "Lately, I've noticed he's a little off. Not quite the stamina he used to have."
Two nights had passed since they last shared a bed.Now, Hannah was throwing it in his face in front of everyone. Vincent could tell she was doing it on purpose.
###Chapter 27 Your Kissing Skills HaveGotten Worse
Sharon gave Vincent a worried look. "I know work keeps you busy, but your health should come first.You need to look after yourself, Vincent."
Vincent offered a quick reassurance. "I will,Grandma." Yet, his gaze drifted to Hannah instead of Sharon.

Danica didn't look pleased. She hated hearing anyone suggest her son might have any shortcomings. She hissed, "Have you no shame,Hannah? How can you talk about something so personal in front of everyone?"
"You were the one who brought it up," Hannah answered, her tone even.only explained why there hasn't been a pregnancy. If you didn't want the answer, you shouldn't have asked. Honestly, I don't care to talk about it either."
Danica sputtered, caught off guard. Hannah had become far bolder lately, never biting her tongue anymore.

But Danica kept telling herself he would only need to tolerate Hannah for a little while longer. Ten more days, at most. She clung to her authority. For now she could still give orders. She shifted her tone and yelled at Hannah, "Go clean out the attic after breakfast!"

Everyone knew that old attic was filled with clutter.Danica just wanted to give Hannah a hard time.

Hannah's reply was flat and direct. "No. I'm not here to play maid."
The last two days, while things were icy between Vincent and Hannah, Danica was eager to pile on more chores, but Hannah refused to do any of them.

Danica rolled her eyes. "Really? All I asked was to move some boxes. Is that such a burden?"

Setting her spoon down, Hannah flashed a dry smile.
"Exactly. I'm much too delicate for that. I can't handle heavy lifting."
"You are absolutely the wrong kind of person to marry into the Jones family!" Danica slammed her hand down hard on the table.

Hannah retorted, "If being your daughter-in-law means I'm just a servant, then I don't want the role at all."
Tension filled the room. Danica drew a breath to argue, but Sharon spoke up. "Enough, both of you.Can we please finish breakfast without turning it into a fight?"
Danica tried to justify herself. "She doesn't show me any respect."
Sharon said calmly,"And you haven't exactly shown her much respect either. Giving her chores? That was out of line."

Once upon a time, Sharon had managed the entire household on her own-her voice still commanded
attention. Just a few words from her were enough to put Danica in her place.
Nobody else dared to direct another comment at Hannah for the remainder of breakfast.

After the meal, Vincent fixed his mother with a stern look. "Stop ordering Hannah around like she's just the help. She's my wife."
Returning to her room, Hannah settled at her desk and began sketching a floral brooch for Sharon's birthday celebration. She had never studied design formally, but she picked up drawing for Vincent's sake. She had already settled on the gladiolus. Its symbolism of honor and strength felt like a fitting way to celebrate Sharon's life.
So deep in concentration, Hannah barely noticed when the door opened. Vincent leaned in close,curiosity clear on his face. "What are you working on?"
Startled, she quickly pulled the sketchbook away."Nothing important. Shouldn't you be at the office?"
She only wanted him out of the room.
His hand slipped up her skirt. "No stamina, huh?"
Hannah swatted his hand away and stood up.
Vincent pressed her gently against the wall, turning the lock on the door behind him.
She pressed her hands against his chest to create some distance and asked, "What's gotten into you?"
"I just want to show you there's nothing wrong with my stamina," he replied, his grin growing wider.
She tried to push him away.are you out of your mind? It's the middle of the day."
"So?" He dipped his head and kissed her without warning.
Hannah clamped her mouth shut and pushed against his chest.
Vincent kissed her hard, insistent.
She fought back, but for a split second, she faltered and he took his chance. His tongue chased hers,relentless.

Cornered, Hannah bit his lip, leaving the taste of blood between them.

He jerked back,startled.

A spark of mischief danced in Hannah's eyes as she wiped her mouth. "Vincent, your kissing skills have gotten worse."
###Chapter 28 Don't Touch Me


Vincent seized the back of Hannah's neck and pressed her against the vanity. His breath came in hot bursts as he leaned even closer. "Then let's test it again. See if I really suck at kissing."

Hannah jerked her head away, planting both hands on his chest to shove him back. "Let go of me!"

"No." Vincent only tightened his grip.

Anger flashed through her. She drove her knee into his stomach. Her elbow knocked over the makeup on the table, sending compacts and bottles tumbling onto the wool carpet.

Drawing in rough breaths, Vincent grabbed for her wrists, using his knee to pry her legs apart.

But then, all at once, Hannah stopped struggling. Her stare was cold and empty as she looked up at him."Don't touch me."

That made him froze.

She used the moment to break free, shoving him away. With one quick motion, she wiped her mouth and said in a low voice, "You make me sick."	~

He felt those words land hard, as if she had slapped him."Sick?" he asked sharply, yanking her back so roughly that she nearly lost her balance.

Her wrist reddened where his hand gripped too tightly.

Hannah snapped back. "Now, whenever you touch me, I feel like throwing up."

Something sharp flickered across his expression. Still, instead of releasing her, he only squeezed harder.

Their breathing mingled in the air-hers coming out fast and angry, his heavy and harsh.

They faced each other in silence until loud pounding on the door echoed.

Danica's shrill voice cut through the tension. "Hlannah! Open this door right now!" She tried the handle,finding it locked. "Why are you locking doors in the middle of the day? What exactly are you hiding?"

A second voice sounded from outside, this one softer and pleading-Brinley."Danica, perhaps we should just let it go."

Danica was not having it."NO,Brinley. You're always too gentle. That's why people take advantage of you."

One thing was clear.Danica would not stop until she got what she wanted for Brinley.

"Hannah, open this door!" Danica's pounding grew even louder. "Don't make me repeat myself!"

The lock clicked at last, but it was Vincent who swung the door open, not Hannah. His face was stormy with anger.

Danica's eyes widened in shock. "Vincent? What are you doing here? I thought you already left for work."

"I didn't," he muttered.

While Danica missed the strained atmosphere, Brinley caught it right away, and her gaze went straight to Hannah's lips. It was obvious enough what had just taken place.

A flash of jealousy burned in Brinley's eyes. She had practically begged Vincent to touch her, and he never did. Yet, with Hannah, in the middle of the day, he could not seem to help himself. What made Hannah so special? Wasn't she just a stand-in?

Quick to hide her feelings, Brinley adjusted her expression and played her part."Danica, let's just leave it alone. There's no point arguing."	a

Danica gave her hand a reassuring pat, still unwilling to back down. "Absolutely not. We can't just let this slide. Vincent deserves to know what kind of person Hannah really is."

Hannah's eyes narrowed. "Then go on. Tell everyone what supposed wrongdoings I did."

Vincent's expression changed. "What happened?"

Danica wasted no time, thrusting her phone at him. "Vincent, you have to look at this. Look at what Hannah's done! These messages prove it-she wanted to hurt Brinley!"

Screenshots filled the phone's display, all showing conversations that seemed to suggest Hannah had arranged for someone to rape Brinley.

Brinley stood off to the side, eyes glistening with tears, her face an image of heartbreak and innocence.

Pointing straight at Hannah, Danica's voice grew shrill with accusation. "You hired someone to harass Brinley! What do you have to say now?"
###Chapter 29 Framed


Vincent's expression grew even colder. "What happened here? Tell me straight."

Brinley lowered her gaze, silent tears slipping down her cheeks.

Danica was the first to explode, grabbing Vincent's arm in outrage."I'd just finished breakfast and went up to check on Brinley. The moment I walked in, I found her in tears. No matter how many times I asked, she wouldn't say a word. That's when I knew-something serious had gone on."

"Get to the point," Vincent snapped, his patience wearing thin.

Danica hesitated for a moment, visibly irritated by the interruption, but then continued, "The point is-Brinley discovered that the harassment at the club was planned. And it was your wife who paid those men!"

Vincent's gaze locked on Brinley. "How do you know it was Hannah?"

Brinley looked as if she wanted to disappear, her face drained and uncertain, as though she hated being the one to speak. Danica rubbed her shoulder and remarked softly, "You can say it, Brinley. We're here to support you."

After that, Danica sent a sharp glare in Hannah's direction.

Hannah ignored her entirely, keeping her attention fixed on the supposed evidence. The phone's screen displayed screenshots of chat logs, messages Brinley claimed had been forwarded to her. The exchange discussed paying two men to scare a woman-harassment was the goal, but anything more would be fine.The payment shown was 100, 000 dollars. The transfer record read: Hannah Scott. This was a setup-meticulously planned from the start.

Hannah arched an eyebrow, looked at Brinley, and said calmly, "That wasn't my doing."

Danica sneered, "Still deny/it? Your name is right there!"

After the scene at breakfast, Danica had been itchy for an opportunity to bring Hannah down. This was exactly what she wanted.

Brinley lingered in silence, looking as if she was wrestling with herself, and finally managed to speak. "That night, after Vincent took me home, I couldn't stop having nightmares. I kept wondering what I'd done wrong,
so I hired someone to investigate. That's how I found those messages and the bank transfer." Tears rolled down her cheeks. "I just never imagined that Hannah would hate me enough to destroy me."

Danica pulled Brinley close, throwing an accusing finger at Hannah. "Did you hear that? And you still refuse to admit what you did? You malicious snake!"

Hannah let out a laugh. "Well, since you're so sure I paid off those men, then bring them in. Let's hear their story right to my face."

Brinley's crying became even more dramatic. "I... I just can't do that. I never want to see those men again.Just the thought of them makes me sick."

Hannah raised an eyebrow. "Or is it possible you're just scared of what might come out?"

Danica erupted. "How can you be so heartless? Can't you see she's traumatized? She doesn't want to relive any of it!"

Naturally, Danica took Brinley's side without question.

Hannah's voice grew cold. "Maybe the real reason Brinley won't face them is because none of it was real.Maybe the whole thing was staged. Maybe this little act is just a way to drag my name through the mud."

Danica flushed with rage."Unbelievable! First,you hurt her, and now, you call her a liar? You're despicable!"

Danica raised her hand, ready to slap Hannah. Vincent stepped in, catching Danica's wrist before she could follow through.
###Chapter 30 Just Wanted An Apology


"We still don't have all the facts," Vincent said with a frown, his voice turning even colder.

Danica grew restless. "Vincent, how can you say that? Brinley's already dug up so much evidence. Hannah did this to her!"

Vincent stayed calm,replying,"1was the one who'd picked Brinley up that day. At that time, Hannah was still in the hospital. How would she have pulled this off?"

Brinley's expression faltered for a brief moment.

Danica muttered, "She must have arranged everything ahead of time. She could have hired those men long before. She didn't need to be there in person."

A wave of cold swept through Hannah. Danica's dislike for her really ran deep. Looking back at how desperately she once tried to earn Danica's approval, she saw now what a waste it had been.

Turning to Vincent, Hannah was surprised. She never expected him to intervene, much less defend her.

Brinley pressed her lips together, tears welling up again. "Vincent, when I first found out about this 1doubted it too. I struggled to believe Hannah would go so far." Tears streamed down her cheeks, every look crafted for sympathy. "But I have proof-a recording. The two men even mentioned her name."

Brinley took out her phone and played the audio for everyone to hear. "The client? Yeah, it was that woman,Hannah... Hannah Scott or something. She said we could do anything to Brinley and promised a big bonus when it was over. Brinley was a reaI looker, smooth skin, tiny waist, any man would want to..."

Brinley hastily stopped the recording, visibly flustered. She looked at Hannah with shaking eyes. "I know you never liked me, and you hated that I came to the Jones house. But I never imagined you'd try to hurt me like this."

Danica kept rubbing Brinley's back in a show of comfort, while Vincent tapped his fingers on the table, his face impossible to read.

Hannah could barely stop herself from laughing. "That's your so-called proof? Getting two guys to say my name in a recording? What exactly does that prove? And if I had actually hired them, do you think I'd have been dumb enough to use my real name?"

Brinley flinched but quickly recovered with a wounded sigh. "Hannah, I only want an apology. But after everything we've shown, you don't even seem a bit sorry."

Hannah folded her arms, her tone unwavering. "Why should I apologize for something I didn't do?"

Fresh tears sparkled in Brinley's eyes. "Then explain why your phone has a video of me being harassed by those men at the club?"

Hannah's eyebrows drew together in confusion. A heavy feeling of dread settled in her stomach."What are you even talking about?"

Before Hannah could react, Danica stepped forward and snatched Hannah's phone out of her grip.

Brinley wasted no time. She opened the photo album, found a video, played it, and shoved the screen in front of Hannah. "Are you still going to claim you had nothing to do with this?"

Brinley's desperate screams echoed from the phone speaker.

Hannah stared at the unfamiliar video playing on her own device. Then, it hit her-just yesterday, Brinley had visited her room, supposedly to discuss plans for Sharon's birthday. Right in the middle of their talk, Danica had called her downstairs. She had left her phone behind. That must have been when Brinley made her move.

Hannah's fists tightened with anger. Brinley must have realized the audio was not enough, so she planted this video as backup-now she was pressing her advantage.

Danica pounced right away. "What now? You're out of excuses. Say sorry to Brinley. Right noW."

Hannah lifted her head, her eyes steady. "If there's a video, why stop at apologies? Let's get the police involved."

Danica's face twisted in outrage. She clutched her forehead."Have you lost it? Dragging this to the police-what does that do for the Jones family?" She shook Vincent's arm, growing frantic. "Vincent, are you just going to let her do as she pleases? Do you really want to involve the police?"

Brinley didn't want to involve the police either. Her eyes welled up as she turned to Vincent. "Vincent, I'm not asking for much. I just want Hannah to apologize. That's it. The police won't fix anything.It'll only reopen my wounds and make me relive it all over again."
Hannah couldn't stand another moment of Brinley's theatrics in front of Vincent. She grabbed the phone back from Brinley's grasp."You want an apology? Let's see what the police think. By the time this is finished, you might owe me an apology."

She started to dial, but Vincent moved fast and blocked the screen with his hand."We're not involving the police," he said, voice flat and final.
###Chapter 31 Just Hollow Concern


Hannah's temper flared. "And why the hell not involve the police?"

Vincent's reply was cold, his grip still tight on her wrist. "It wouldn't be good for Brinley's reputation."

Hannah smirked. So that was all it came down to. Brinley's image meant everything. As for her, the stand-in,she never even factored into his thinking. Any hint of warmth she'd felt earlier when he spoke up for her vanished in aheartbeat. What a joke. He was trash.

With a sharp motion, Hannah slapped his hand away, refusing to back down. "That's rich, coming from you.Your affair with Brinley has already made it into every gossip column. But now you're suddenly afraid of bad press?" There was steel in her voice. No one would stop her. "I'm calling the police. No one could stop me."

Since they wanted to drag her name through the mud, she would defend herself-no more silent suffering.

Brinley/ saw that Hannah meant it and quickly panicked. She lunged and shoved Hannah-hard enough to make Hannah slam into the corner of the table.

Hannah's phone went flying, clattering against the floor.

Seizing the moment, Brinley leaned backward to make it look like she somehow lost her balance,all the while she extended her hands to wrap her arms around Vincent's neck, clinging to him like some helpless damsel. And she didn't stop there. As she played the victim, she pressed her heel down on Hannah's phone over and over.

So this was the scene Hannah took in: her husband supporting the very woman who had shoved her on purpose. And he just stood there, showing concern toward her attacker instead of helping her. The irony was almost laughable.Pain shot up her lower back-it would definitely bruise. It hurt like hell.

Brinley straightened up and remarked to Vincent in a gentle, unsteady voice, "Thank you."

Hannah let out a mocking smile and picked up her shattered phone. "Really, you should be thanking me. lf you hadn't slammed into me, you never would have landed in Vincent's arms."

With downcast eyes, Brinley said in a quiet voice, "I'm sorry, Hannah. I just didn't want things to spiral out of control. I got carried away... I didn't mean to hurt you." She made it sound so noble, as though every move was for the Jones family'ssake.

A cold laugh escaped Hannah as she waved the ruined phone. "What's the plan? Break my phone so I can't call the cops? You really think that's enough to stop me?"

Danica, for her part, looked delighted. At least, Hannah couldn't involve the police for now. The last thing she wanted was to become tea-time gossip among Dorbarrow's upper crust. She much preferred being waited on and praised, not whispered about over tea.

Vincent moved closer to Hannah. "Where are you hurt?"

Hannah jerked away from him, her face stone-cold. "Don't act concerned."

He cast a hard look at Danica and Brinley, keeping his tone low. "Leave us."

Danica pressed her lips together. "Not until Hannah says sorry to Brinley."

"I said leave," Vincent remarked, the lines on his forehead deepening.

Danica wanted to protest, but with one look at his expression, she fell silent and slipped out.

Brinley followed Danica reluctantly, not before throwing one sharp glare Hannah's way.

Closing the door, Vincent tried to lift Hannah's shirt to check for injuries.

She slapped his hand away. "What, you still want to make out with me?"

His expression darkened. "I just want to check your injury."

"I'm fine. Go get cozy with Brinley instead," Hannah retorted, heading for the door.

Vincent stopped her and gently pushed her onto the bed. "Lie down. Let me see your back."

"I said no." She squirmed and tried to get up, but he straddled her and pinned her wrists with one hand.

With his free hand, he lifted her shirt. A large, deep bruise had already started to form along her waist.

His fingers brushed against the bruise, and Hannah sucked in a breath, the pain sharp and sudden. "If you just want to look, then keep your hands off," she said, brow furrowed in discomfort.
He softened his touch and spoke quietly."Let me put some ointment on it."

She glared at him. "I don't need your help."

Vincent fetched the first-aid kit anyway. Ignoring her protest, he pinned her in place, lifted her shirt again,and started to apply the ointment.

Realizing there was no point resisting, Hannah lay back and kept still. So Vincent still cared-at least, a little.If all this hadn't happened, maybe this gesture from him would've made her happy. But now, it didn't stir anything in her at all. It was just hollow concern.
###Chapter 32 Let's Get A Divorce


Vincent pushed his sleeves up to his elbows. He warmed his hands by rubbing them together, and then gently began to work the bruise on Hannah's waist. His touch was light and careful, never once causing her any pain.

A thick silence filled the space between them.

After a while, Vincent spoke in a low voice. "Brinley isn't a bad person. She didn't mean any of this. Don't hold it against her."

A sharp, bitter laugh escaped Hannah. So this was why he applied the ointment for her, not out of care, but to keep her from calling the police and to prevent things from getting out of hand. So much for concern.It was all for another woman.

Hannah pushed herself upright, tilting her chin as she stared at him with a cold smirk. "Vincent, did you miss what just happened, or do you just not want to see it? She started all of this, and now you want me to just let it go? I'm not that forgiving."

Disappointment shone in her eyes as she brushed his hand away.

Vincent stayed where he was, pressing his fingers to the bridge of his nose, frustration plain on his face."You weren't like this before."

His words made Hannah freeze. Not like this before? A chill swept through her, leaving her numb. He'd reminded her of how she used to bend over backward for his family. Now that she no longer cared to hide her sharp edges, he missed the tolerant and gentle version of her. But that girl? Vincent had killed her with his own hands. No. Precisely speaking, he didn't miss her past self. He missed the docile, self-sacrificinggirl who reminded him of Brinley.

Her eyes went frosty. She kicked him away."Just leave. Go be with your precious Brinley."

"I'm not finished with the ointment," Vincent replied, voice tight and strained.

"I don't need your help with the ointment. The pain doesn't bother me." She turned her head away, the sting from the ointment and the throb in her waist paled in comparison to the ache in her chest. Her heart felt like it was bleeding.
Vincent's jaw tightened. Brinley had become a sore spot between them-mention her once, and Hannah's claws came out. Every time, they ended up fighting. How had everything fallen apart so completely? They could not go even a minute without falling into an argument.

Another heavy silence settled over the room.

At last, Hannah stood up, her eyes fixed on the floor. "Vincent, we really can't go on like this." She drew in a steady breath. "Let's get a divorce."

Darkness clouded Vincent's face. "That's not happening. Just drop that idea."

A wry smile touched her lips. "Vincent, don't be stubborn. What's the point of dragging this out?" He was the one who'd treated her as Brinley's stand-in-and yet he was also the one who refused to let her go.

"You want a divorce that badly?" His gaze pinned her down.

"I'm sick." Hannah lifted her eyes, her stare distant, as if he were nothing but a stranger now. "Five years is long enough."

They had spent five years as husband and wife. For five years, she'd given him everything she had while he'd treated her like a substitute for Brinley. She didn't want to go on like this anymore.

The silence grew even heavier.

Vincent stared at her, emotion flickering in his eyes-fury, disbelief, and something darker. Her eyes burned with quiet resolve, adding to his inner turmoil.

"It's not happening," he said at last, his tone leaving no room for argument."Get that idea out of your head."

She gave him a small, empty smile. "Vincent, aren't you tired by all this?"

Five years of looking at her, seeing only Brinley's shadow-wasn't he sick of it? She had been a stand-in for five years without realizing it until recently. Even if he was fine with it, she was finished.

She swallowed her bitterness and added, "If we divorce, you can give Brinley a proper title. That's better than whatever this mess is."

Vincent's mouth set in a hard line. His expression was thunderous. "I've already told you, whatever you think about Brinley and me,you're wrong."

A storm of tension thickened the air.
Just then, a knock broke through the heaviness. "Mr. Jones, your meeting is about to start," Derek remarked from the other side of the door.
###Chapter 33 They Once Had A Child


"Alright," Vincent said to Derek before shifting hisattention back to Hannah. "P'll handle this. You stay put and get some rest. From this moment on, I don't want to hear you mention 'divorce' ever again."

Without another word, he stepped out and closed the door behind him. He hadn't taken Hannah's talk of divorce seriously. He was convinced Hannah loved him far too deeply to ever mean it.

A bitter, almost mocking smile played on Hannah's lips. He hadn't even bothered to give her an answer to her simple question.

Inside the Bentley, Derek noticed the tension in Vincent's face, his brows pulled tight with worry."Another fight with Mrs. Jones?" he asked, his voice cautious as he didn't want to press too hard.

No reply came from Vincent.

Derek forced a weak laugh, still determined to offer advice."Mr. Jones, you're going about this all wrong.Women always need a little sweet-talking."

Derek clearly thought he knew a thing or two aboout relationships and was just getting warmed up when Vincent shot him a cold, warning glare. Instantly,he fell silent.

Vincent's thoughts wandered. His memories took him back to childhood-he had grown up alongside Brinley and her brother. When he was seven, he and her brother had tumbled into the sea together.Brinley's father had reached him first before going back for his own son, but the tide had been merciless, swallowing them both. Brinley had only been five years old then.

Shaking the memory away, Vincent turned to Derek, frown deepening. "Check what happened at Midnight Veil,especially with those two men who'd harassed Brinley."

"Understood," Derek replied.

A moment of hesitation showed on Derek's face before he asked, "Should I keep looking into the jacket's owner?"

"Keep digging into it," Vincent answered, voice clipped.

"Got it."
On her end, Hannah still filed a report with the police. Unfortuhately, without concrete evidence,the case remained at a standstill. Determined not to let the matter drop, she brought in a private detective.She was done watching the truth slip away. This time, she promised herself, she would stand her ground and fight back.

A short while later, she found herself at a phone repair shop-there was a precious photo on that phone, and she needed it restored at any cost.

The technician gave her a knowing look and a half-smile. "Let me guess, lost pictures with your boyfriend?Sentimental memories mean a lot, don't they?"

Hannah met his gaze with a small, polite smile and stayed silent.

Competence was clearly the technician's specialty. In only a few minutes, he managed to power the device back up.

Nervous energy filled Hannah's hands as she scrolled through the photos. One album caught her eye-Family. She selected a single black-and-white image and quickly sent it to her new phone. "Everything's done. Thank you," she said, gratitude flickering in her soft smile.

Curiosity lingered on the technician's face. "That's all? There are dozens more photos in that album."

"No, I just need this one," she replied simply. For her, the most precious photo was not a picture of her and Vincent, but the ultrasound of their child when it was just a month old.

The technician stood by the counter, momentarily puzzled, as Hannah gathered her things and walked away without a second glance.

She and Vincent had once had a child. But he didn't know. She had been overjoyed when she first learned she was pregnant. She had everything planned-a romantic dinner, a framed printout of the ultrasound,ready to surprise him. But he hadn't walked through the door that night. His voice had come over the phone,distant and cold. "Don't wait up."

Still, she had wanted to tell him the good news in person. The next morning, she dressed with care, set her disappointment aside, and had the drivertake her straight to Vincent's office. But no luck-Vincent was nowhere to be found. He had already left the country on an urgent trip.
The secretaries had mentioned it had something to do with work tied to a subsidiary, but also to reconnect with his first love.

That was when Hannah had first found out that Vincent's first love lived abroad. Hurt and furious, she'd kept calling him again and again, but he never once answered.

And the secretaries? They'd scorned her, urging her to stop hanging on to Vincent and do something useful.Said she was perfectly capable-why not earn a decent living instead of being Vincent's kept woman?

Their words had struck something raw. And Hannah had been at a loss to defend herself. She couldn't just reveal her secret marriage to Vincent.
###Chapter 34 A Threat


After returning from his trip abroad, Vincent had buried himself under endless paperwork, leaving Hannah with no chance to mention her pregnancy.

Then, trouble struck in the most mundane way-Hannah had accidentally slipped in the bathroom, panic setting in as blood began to pour. Desperate, she'd dialed Vincent's number twenty-nine times without pause. But not once had he answered. The delay of prompt treatment had cost her dearly. Their infant,only a month along, hadn't made it.

During Hannah's entire hospital stay post miscarriage, Vincent had never set foot in her ward or reached out since he-remained oblivious to her pregnancy, let alone her miscarriage.

After her release from the hospital, she'd kept the ultrasound photo as her only remembrance, ripping up the printout she'd once placed at home as if to erase a ###Chapter of hope.

This was why Brinley's screenshot showing twenty-one calls from Vincent had hit Hannah like a blow-Vincent had never panicked for her like that. When she had desperately needed him, he hadn't bothered to pick up her calls. All those feelings, however, seemed distant now.

Arriving home, Hannah bumped into Derek, who had returned to grab some work files for Vincent. A simple question passed her lips. "Did I leave a suit jacket in the car the other day?"

Maybe Miles wouldn't care about a jacket, but Hannah felt returning it was the right thing to do. Whether or not he accepted it-that was his business.

Derek hesitated, feigning ignorance. "Mrs. Jones, I didn't notice anything."

Her brow knitted in suspicion. "Please look for it for me. I'm sure it's in the car somewhere."

He gave a quick nod. "Alright."

Stepping inside, Hannah barely made it past the hallway before Danica intercepted her, voice sharp with accusation."I knew it-you hit a dead end with the police, didn't you? How does it feel to hit a wall?"

Suspicion narrowed Hannah's eyes. "Did you follow me?"

Danica didn't bother to deny it."So what if I was? Someone has to keep you from disgracing the Jones family.You're leaving Vincent-why do you keep stirring up trouble?"

A sardonic chuckle escaped Hannah. Her gaze frosted over."Let's set the record straight, Danica, if I wanted drama, I'd tear up that divorce agreement and sit tight as Vincent's wife."

Fury crashed across Danica's face as she slammed her palm on the table. "Don't you dare!"

"Try me," Hannah replied, folding her arms. "Friendly reminder-you've got 16 days left before transferring the rest of your properties to me. When will I see those deeds?"

"I told you already-property transfers take time! What's got you breathing down my neck?" Danica practically shouted.

Hannah's smile was icy. "Don't get it twisted. I'm not impatient. But let me spell this out-those seven properties better show up, or you can forget ever seeing the divorce agreement again. Let's see who panics first." She casually straightened Danica's collar. "Looking forward to hearing some progress on the property transfer."

With that,Hannah turned on her heel and made for the stairs.

The thud and crash of furniture being overturned filled the house seconds later, but Hannah climbed the steps without missing a beat. Once in her room, thoughts of rest vanished when Felix's name popped up on her phone. The office needed her, so out the door she went.	a

Chaos found its way online that night as Nova Tech suddenly faced a tidal wave of public criticism over product safety. A group calling themselves "Victims of Nova Tech" appeared almost overnight.

The company's response was swift-a product recall was announced, along with a flurry of compensation offers for angry customers.

Hannah started digging into the detailed info of the supposed victims, and her search pointed straight to an apartment complex not far from her company. That detail set off every alarm in her mind.

Hours slipped by as she combed through data, and it was deep into the night before she made it back to the Jones estate.

A little sleep did nothing to slow her down. Plans for Sharon's birthday party came next on her never-ending list.
Meanwhile, things at the Jones Group office took a surprising turn. Vincent delivered two orders to Clive.First, he wanted every last project completed within the month because he intended to take a three-month break. Second, he instructed Clive to arrange for a ring with a sixteen-millimeter inner diameter and made it clear that the ring needed to be delivered within three months.

For a moment, Clive could only stare. His mind raced-was Vincent about to propose to Brinley?
###Chapter 35 Guilt-trip Him


No sooner had Clive finished wondering about Vincent's big plans than Brinley arrived, breezing through the reception.

"Hello, Mr. Monroe. Is Vincent available right now?" Brinley purred.

A spark of intrigue lit up Clive's eyes. "He's in his office," he answered, barely hiding his excitement.

An odd glance from Brinley caught his expression, but she let it go without a word.

Earlier, Clive had nearly spilled Vincent's request for a ring in his surprise-luckily, he managed to hold back.

Skipping any kind of announcement, Brinley swung open Vincent's office door and stepped inside. "Are you free at the moment, Vincent?"

Without looking away from his paperwork, Vincent responded, "Next time, try knocking first."

Although she pulled a face, she didn't protest.

"Is there something you needed?" he asked, eyes still glued to the document in his hands.

"Vincent, would it be possible for me to get a job here?" Her voice softened as she approached his desk.

Bills were piling up for her. Despite the support Vincent had provided-both abroad and since she returned -she had drained her funds paying off the two men she'd once hired. Panic set in after hearing about Hannah's trip to the police, and she ended up spending even more to make sure those two men disappeared for good.

It wasn't until then that Vincent set his work aside, studying her with a puzzled look. "You have no plan to return to Bellavia?"

That idea was out of the question for her. With his divorce on the horizon, she planned to stay and finally take her place as his wife, "I'm not going back," she replied, shaking her head for emphasis.

"But I thought your stay in the city was temporary," Vincent insisted, his brow furrowed.

A little smile played on Brinley's lips. "Originally, I did mean to just take a break before going back. But it's warmer here than I remembered. Honestly, I don't want to leave anymore."
With her lashes lowered, a subtle shadow of sorrow crossed her features. "Years back, my mother remarried overseas. After she had my younger brother, she barely acknowledged me anymore. Whenever I'm unwell,I go to the hospital on my own. That house isn't a home. It's just empty and cold. I can't bear the thought of returning. If my father and brother were still around, they'd never let things get this bad for me."

A faint wave of sympathy flickered in Vincent's eyes. After a moment's pause, he spoke. "There's a subsidiary of Jones Group called Polaris Tech. I'll put you in charge of it. There's an apartment close by, and you can move in as soon as you'd like. Clive will see to all the details."

Brinley was caught off guard, surprise and happiness lighting up her face. He was practically handing her an entire company. That had to mean he truly cared for her. Her smile turned soft and grateful."Thank you,Vincent. I won't let you down."

"Good," he replied.

Uncertainty crept back into Brinley's voice as she asked, "What about Hannah? She did hire those men to harass me, but since nothing actually happened, maybe we can just let it go?"

Vincent redirected his attention to the papers in front of him. "I'll handle it."

A quiet nod from Brinley. "Thanks for everything, Vincent."

No sooner had she walked out than Vincent's phone buzzed with Derek's name on the screen. "Mr. Jones,those two guys who went after Miss Gilbert have already gone back to their hometowns. Should we keep tracking them down?"

"Don't stop. Keep investigating." Vincent pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, trying to stave off a headache.

After a pause, Derek said, "There's one more thing. When I dropped by your house for the files, Mrs. Jones asked about the suit jacket. I brushed her off with a white lie, but... Should I just buy her an identical one?"

A muscle jumped in Vincent's jaw as his gaze landed on the wedding ring glinting coldly on his hand."Boredom must really be getting to you," he replied, his tone icy enough to send a chill down the phone.

Clearly, that meant "no." Derek frowned. How was he supposed to answer Hannah if she asked again? He couldn't admit the jacket had been thrown away on Vincent's orders, could he?

After ending the call, Vincent's expression hardened, unreadable in the dim light. Was she seriously worried about another man's jacket?
###Chapter 36 Marital Assets


Lately, Vincent's late nights at the office had become routine, barely making it back home to rest. This was nothing new to Hannah. She'd grown accustomed to his absence due to work-related stuff years ago.

Over the next two nights, Hannah poured her energy into perfecting every detail of Sharon's upcoming birthday celebration. Drawing on a sense of nostalgia, she passed on Brinley's suggestions for lavish hotels and castle venues, opting instead to transform the Jones family estate into something magical. She didn't stop there. A carefully worded email went out to Sharon's favorite classicaI orchestra. Booking such a renowned ensemble was no small feat, but she figured it was worth a shot.

Meanwhile, the company had already pulled every flawed product from the shelves. With that hurdle cleared, her sights shifted to a new mission-developing a new line of women's personal safety devices. For her, nothing outranked the product development. Only by launching something reliable and innovative could she have the confidence to revisit the idea of collaborating with Miles.

Long before, her sonic earring design had become a national sensation, blending style with security. Their success had faded, though, as trends shifted and competitors multiplied.

Now, she brought every top mind in the company together, building a single powerhouse team focused entirely on the new product launch.

Most days found Hannah at her desk from sunrise until long after dark. Immersing herself in work was more than a habit. It was the only way to drown out everything else.

Late one evening, she finally returned home, just as the clock struck ten. A message blinked on her phone from the private detective-he had located the two men and paid them to speak the truth. He sent her a recording. She returned to her room, closed the door, and listened to it. Just as she had expected, both men confessed they had been hired by Brinley.

Hannah immediately texted him back. "Turn them over to the Dorbarrow police."

Lost in thought, she suddenly felt a presence at the doorway of her room and looked over. Beside the wide open door, Brinley stood there, arms folded and eyes glinting.

"The banquet's only days away, and you're still scrolling on your phone?" Brinley taunted, her voice thick with disdain.

Annoyance flickered across Hannah's face. "Hasn't anyone ever told you to knock before walking into someone else's room?"

A roll of her eyes was Brinley's only answer. "Why bother? Once I marry into this family, I'll have the run of the place. Doors won't matter."

Hannah met her gaze with a soft, unbothered laugh."Do not get ahead of yourself just yet. Last | checked,the title of Mrs. Jones still belongs to me."

"Mrs. Jones?" Brinley's laughter rang out, her gaze full of scorn."Do you actually believe you deserve that title? Vincent's been married to you for five years and has never once acknowledged you publicly, like you're just some mistress he tucked away. Not a soul sees you as his rightful wife. How pathetic."

Five years of being labeled as the"mistress" while she was actually Vincent's rightful wife had dulled the sting for Hannah. Brinley's barbs rolled right off; only someone naïve would think they could still wound her.

A calm reply slipped from Hannah's lips. "Pathetic? Look in the mirror, Brinley. You throw tantrums and spin little plots, but after all that effort, you're still standing on the sidelines. No wonder you're obsessed with pestering me, Vincent's real wife."

"You..." Color crept up Brinley's cheeks, though she smoothed her expression and flashed a smug grm."Here's something you might not know: Vincent just handed me the reins of one of the Jones Group's subsidiaries. Even gave me an apartment nearby."

Brinley paused to admire her flawless nails, smirking. "Meanwhile, what have you gotten in your five years as Mrs. Jones? He doesn't love you, and he sure doesn't appreciate your abilities."

Even though Hannah had endured so much, hearing thnat Vincent gifted Brinley a whole business made her chest tighten for a moment. He'd told her she didn't need a job, only to turn around and ggive Brinley an entire company. That old ache was quickly pushed aside-after all, divorce was on the horizon, and none of it really mattered anymore.

Composure returned to Hannah's face as she met Brinley's gaze. "It seems Vincent's been quite generous with you. All the more reason for you not to mess with me. If you push me too far, that shiny company and apartment might slip right through your fingers. So you'd better tread carefully around me."

An eye roll was Brinley's answer. "Since when did you get to dedicate the company and apartment Vincent had offered me?"

Matter-of-factly, Hannah replied, "They're part of the marital assets I share with Vincent. So yes,they absolutely concern me. If I decide I want them back, I have every right."

A sneer curled Brinley's lips. "You're heading for a divorce. What marital assets?"

Laughter bubbled out of Hannah. "That divorce agreement is still in my hands. Whether we split or not depends on my say-so. I'm the one in control, Brinley. Feel free to test me-see if I will kick you out of that apartment."
###Chapter 37 Shared A Bed


A glare full of venom shot from Brinley's eyes. "You shameless bitch!"

Unbothered, Hannah gestured toward the door."Say whatever you want. Now do us both a favor and leave my room."

A sharp retort from Brinley followed. "As if I'd stick around any longer than I have to. Sharon sent me to fetch you for dinner."

Before heading out, Brinley's eyes darted to Hannah's laptop screen. In that split second, something cold and vicious flickered in her face. She had overheard the recording on Hannah's phone just now.

Having realized Hannah was on her trail and actually gathering proof, Brinley's nails dug into her palms,anger simmering just beneath the surface. There was no way she'd let Hannah uncover the truth and turn the tables on her. Not a chance.

Hannah, oblivious to Brinley's scheming, was too busy to care. With days of skipped meals catching up to her, Sharon's invitation was as much about concern as family tradition. She closed her laptop and made her way downstairs.

The last thing Hannah expected was to see Vincent waiting at the table.

"If I hadn't called, would you have even bothered returning for dinner, Vincent?" A tired sigh escaped Sharon.

Vincent glanced up briefly, just long enough for his and Hannah's eyes to meet before both looked away."Work's been nonstop."

Sharon's patience was wearing thin. "Work demands your presence 24/7, huh? You can't even show your face at home. No wonder I still don't have a great-grandchild."

Vincent pressed his fingers to his temples. "Grandma, making a baby isn't that simple. It couldn't be rushed."

The response didn't soften her expression. "Time isn't on my side. When do you plan to try to have a baby with Hannah? After I'm dead and buried? I don't care what's on your schedule tonight. After dinner, you're going upstairs with Hannah."

Hannah's brow twitched. Sharing a bed with Vincent? Hell no.

Pulling Hannah closer, Sharon's tone gentled. "Sweetheart, I know you've been putting in long hours.Please, get some rest tonight. I just want what's best for you."

A hint of awkwardness colored Hannah's reply. "Alright."

Brinley, refusing to fade into the background, hurried over to Vincent and eagerly launched into a discussion about the subsidiary's affairs.

Every now and then, Vincent offered a suggestion or nodded along, giving her just enough attention.

All the while, Hannah kept her eyes on her plate, not saying a word as the conversation swirled around her.

Once dinner ended, Hannah wasted no time slipping away, drawn back to her laptop to finish up details for Sharon's birthday celebration.

Not long after, Vincent emerged from the shower, hair damp and water still clinging to his neck.He reached for the hairdryer and then eventually collapsed onto the bed without a word.

Sharon's insistence meant he was spending the night at home for a change.

With her work finished, Hannah slipped into the bathroom, showered, and climbed into bed, staking out the very edge of the mattress for herself.

That silence didn't last long. The bed dipped under Vincent's weight as he shifted closer, arms finding their way around her waist.

She stiffened and then wriggled free. "If you want sex, Brinley's room is upstairs."

"Don't move. Just let me hold you," he murmured, pulling her back into his arms. She smelled faintly of her citrusy body wash.

He sounded utterly exhausted. When it became clear she wouldn't break his grip, she stopped resisting.Soon,his steady breathing filled the silence-he had fallen asleep.

Pushing him away seemed pointless. With only two weeks left before the divorce, she figured there was no sense turning it into a war zone. Besides, exhaustion from work and party planning had kept her own sleep fitful at best. Eventually, she let herself relax and surrendered to sleep.
Morning arrived to find herself curled against Vincent's chest, one arm slung across his waist. His pajama shirt hung slightly open, a few buttons mysteriously undone.

Propping himself up, Vincent met her gaze. "Did you rest well?"

Without missing a moment, Hannah slid out of bed, her face unreadable. "You're not exactly winning points as a cuddle buddy. You're far worse than the male escorts I've hired."
###Chapter 38 Your FullMakeup Was For A Date...
A glimmer of satisfaction flickered in Hannah's eyes as Vincent's expression turned stormy. She turned on her heel and walked into the bathroom.



A meticulous makeup routine followed-foundation,blush, eyeliner, lipstick-each detail flawless. With a trip to the police station ahead, Hannah wasn't leaving anything to chance.



Spotting her reflection, Vincent straightened his tie and watched the pleased smile touch her lips. "Where are you headed today?" he asked quietly



Bright as day, Hannah met his gaze in the mirror."That's none of your concern."



In a flash of frustration, Vincent flung his watch onto the dresser, seized her wrist, and pressed her firmly against the vanity.



Without bothering to look up, Hannah tried to twist away from his grip, irritation in every movement.


"Why do you shy away from me? Is there something you're trying to keep from me?" Vincent pressed and tightened his grip on her.
His gaze lingered over her face. Her makeup only heightened her natural beauty. He was momentarily dazed and couldn't tear his eyes off her.


Sensing his brief distraction, Hannah wrenched free and scowled. "Quit grabbing me.I'mnotyour property."



A heavy silence hung in the air as Vincent reclaimed his watch. "Your lipstick's smeared," he said flatly


Once he left, Hannah checked her reflection again.Not a single flaw could be found-her lipstick was as perfect as before. Shrugging it off, she closed her compact and set it aside.



Hannah headed out, destination clear-the police station. Her statement was recorded, and a formal case was opened. Only one step remained: waiting for the authorities to summon Brinley for questioning.



Her next stop was the office. Brainstorming with her team, she floated the idea of a safety bracelet designed for women. While thoughts and sketches filled her mind, she reached for her phone,hoping to capture the inspiration.



Instead, a notification lit up her screen-Brinley had just posted on Instagram: "Four all-nighters later-finally done. Hope Sharon will love it."


In the photo, Brinley was holding onto a man's arm.
And with just one glance, Hannah recognized the owner immediately-it was Vincent's. Suddenly,the exhaustion Vincent had shown last night made perfect sense. He'd been busy helping Brinley with the banquet planning, not just with work.



A sharp sting shot through Hannah's palm as her nails dug in, her composure briefly faltering.



Pushing the phone aside, Hannah forced herself to focus on the meeting. She threw herself into work,staying long after everyone else had left.


At the end of the day, Felix insisted on driving Hannah home. She didn't refuse.



Chivalry came naturally to Felix. He opened the car door for her when they arrived.



A quiet "Thank you" escaped Hannah's lips. But as she stepped onto the driveway, Vincent's figure came into view, standing a few yards away, watching with cold intensity. His mood was unmistakably sour.



Hannah acted like she didn't notice Vincent's foul mood, waving as she said goodbye to Felix. Then,she turned to walk toward the house and taunted Vincent,not breaking her stride, "Switching careers to bodyguard now? I guess it suits you."


Vincent ignored the jibe and trailed her. Shadows darkened his features. "So the full face of makeup was for your date with another man?"


Darkness flashed in Vincent's eyes, displeasure etched in every line of his face.


Planting her feet, Hannah spun around and met his gaze,chin tipped up in challenge. "That's right. Got an issue with it?"



A scowl deepened across Vincent's brow. "Felix Wade.CEO of Nova Tech. Focuses on women's security gadgets.His company's hanging by a thread."



A spark of surprise flickered across Hannah's face as she faced him fully. "You really went out of your way to dig into him?"


Annoyance quickly replaced her surprise.


He sidestepped her question, letting his voice go icy."Is he the reason behind your desire for a divorce?Discarding me for a man about to lose his business?"



She replied instantly, "Felix has nothing to do with my request for a divorce."



A muscle tensed in Vincent's jaw. "You'd better mean your words. Because if he is the reason, I'll make sure his pathetic little company collapses by tomorrów."


A heaviness pressed on Hannah's chest. She leveled her voice. "Vincent, what's gotten into you? Felix hasn't crossed you."


"If I'm pissed off, then yeah, he has."


No words came as she stared at him, feeling the familiar wall of his stubbornness. "You..."



The silence stretched, thick and uneasy.



A passing gust lifted the hem of Hannah's pale green dress, the fabric trailing across Vincent's shoes.



Without a word, he slipped off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Wind's picking up. Let's go inside."



She didn't move, eyes downcast. "I'm not cold."


She then shrugged off the jacket. It slipped from her shoulders and fell to the ground.


Without a backward glance, Hannah walked ahead.


A lump formed in Vincent's throat. He opened his mouth but couldn't find the words.



Just then, his phone buzzed. He answered, voice like steel. "Talk."



Derek's words came quickly. "Mr. Jones, I've confirmed the harassment incident involving Miss Gilbert. It's real." After a brief pause, he added, "But it seems your wife might have something to do with it."
###Chapter 39 Video Leaked


Stepping down from the third floor, Brinley paused mid-step as Vincent's voice drifted from the hall,deep in conversation with his assistant.

Reacting instantly, she ducked behind a column and stayed out of sight, her ears straining to catch every word.Every detail of Vincent's exchange with Derek filtered through, reaching her ears.

Brinley allowed herself a smug smile. Cautious planning had paid off. The moment she discovered Hannah was investigating her, she'd made sure to payoff the two men who'd fled back to their hometown, coaching them to play along to fool Hannah's detective, only to change their story when giving their statements in the police station. A bundle of cash had easily bought their cooperation. Yet, Vincent's unexpected investigation sent a jolt of unease through her.

With quiet urgency, Brinley slipped back to her room, phone already in hand as she speed-dialed her favorite gossip reporter."Do it now. Release everything."

Without missing a beat, she called the police next. "I want to report a crime. Someone hired men to assault me."

By eight that night, the hashtag # CEO of Jones Group's First Love Harassed exploded across every social platform. Though the face in the video was blurry, anyone familiar with Brinley recognized her at a glance.

To summon the right tears, Brinley pinched her thigh until her eyes watered. The moment Vincent walked through the door, she rushed downstairs, cryingon cue.

Meanwhile, Hannah sat with Sharon in the living room, lost in quiet conversation.

Brinley burst in, voice trembling. "Hannah, do you hate me that much?" She made a beeline for Hannah and latched onto Hannah's hand.

A quick jerk freed Hannah's hand. Folding her arms, she met Brinley's accusation head-on. "Yes, I can't stand you. I don't have the energy to pretend otherwise."

Brinley raised her volume, tears streaming. "So you're admitting it, then?"

Confusion clouded Hannah's face as her brow furrowed. "Admitting to what?" Every instinct screamed this was another setup.

The commotion drew Danica over, her concern painted in worried lines. "Brinley, what happened? Why are you in tears?"

"Whatever it is, sit down and sort this out like civilized people." Sharon rapped her cane against the floor,her voice steady.

A deep crease furrowed Vincent's brow as he took in the tense exchange.

Before anyone else could speak, Brinley jumped in, voice trembling. "Sharon, I swear, causing drama was never my intention. It's just that Hannah can't stand me and even went out of her way to plot against me.Here,look for yourself."

Tears hidden behind one hand, Brinley showed her phone screen for the gathered crowd to see, the headline blaring.

Danica took one glance and went rigid. That was the exact same footage she'd glimpsed earlier on Hannah's phone. Eyes narrowed, she swung her glare to Hannah. "Did you leak the video to the press?"

Sharon, struggling to catch the thread of accusations, turned to Vincent for answers. "What video are they talking about?"

Eager to deliver proof, Danica started to hand the phone over, but Hannah moved faster, snatching it from her grip.

That move made Danica erupt. "What's your problem, Hannah?" Realization dawned a second later."1see what this is. You're scared. You don't want Sharon to see what kind of person you really are."

A spark of satisfaction danced in Brinley's eyes. With Danica fueling the conflict, she could simply stand back-her tears would do the rest.

Sharp words from Danica soured Sharon's expression. Sharon snapped,"That's enough, Danica. How could you accuse Hannah like that?"

Refusing to back down, Danica tried to push the issue. "Sharon, you don't know the half of it..."

A single icy look from Vincent silenced her instantly.

Hannah kept her focus on Sharon, her tone gentle and steady. "Please, don't worry. I'll handle this myself."
Sadness flashed across Sharon's face as she reached for Hannah's hand. "Tell me what's wrong,sweetheart. There's nothing to be afraid of. I'll help you-did Vincent hurt you?"

Hannah had married into the Jones family but was never publicly acknowledged due to her secret marriage to Vincent. Over the years, she had endured far too much. Sharon's heart ached for Hannah.

Hannah's vision blurred for a moment, touched by Sharon's concern. She had no intention of dragging Sharon into family squabbles, and she was just about to suggest Sharon go rest, when Brinley interjected with a trembling voice,it because I'm an outsider that you put your trust only in Hannah?" Tears shimmered in her eyes.
###Chapter 40 Cornered Without Proof


With a quiet tenderness, Sharon brushed a stray lock of hair behind Hannah's ear, ignoring Brinley's attempt to steal her attention.

At that moment, Vincent told the housekeeper, "Aubrey, please help Grandma upstairs so she can get some rest."

Sharon, however,planted her feet, defiance in her eyes. "You're trying to get rid of me because you really did do something to hurt Hannah, didn't you? Tonight, I'm staying put to make sure she gets the justice she deserves." A gentle cough punctuated her stubbornness.

Concern flashed across Hannah's face as she patted Sharon's back. "Don't worry about me. I'll be alright,really. Just go rest for a bit, please?"

Sharon's health was fragile. Hannah couldn't bear the thought of her being dragged into another stressful scene.

"Lies. Don't bother trying to send me away," Sharon insisted, her voice strained and her breath unsteady."I won't leave you alone-not when someone here might mistreat you."

Years of watching Hannah try to keep the peace with Danica had left a mark on Sharon. Even when Danica hurled the most awful words at Hannah, Hannah had never shown anything but a polite smile.

Seeing this, Danica's anger bubbled over. "This is all your fault, Hannah. Look how upset you've made Sharon!"

Ignoring the accusation, Hannah turned to Aubrey. "Please, just see that Sharon gets comfortable upstairs."Looking Sharon in the eye, she added softly,"1anything happens to you because of me, I'd never forgive myself. I promise, if I need help, I'll come straight to you. I'm right here. You'll hear if something's wrong."

Aubrey chimed in, "She's right. Please trust that she can handle the situation. And Mr. Jones is here. He won't let her be mistreated."

Sharon huffed, "Vincent is the one who's made things so difficult for Hannah." A finger pointed squarely at Vincent, her tone cutting. "Hannah is your wife. Don't you dare keep hurting her to please anyone else. Do you hear me?"
Brinley's face fell. She caught onto the insinuation immediately.

Vincent murmured, "I understand."

A gentle squeeze of Hannah's hand served as Sharon's goodbye, and finally, she allowed herself to be led upstairs. She knew that if she stayed and her health failed, it would only worry Hannah. Deep down, she recognized her limits-she couldn't shield Hannah forever. Marriage, after all, was something Hannah and Vincent needed to navigate together.

No sooner had Sharon left the room than Danica pounced, voice sharp. "Hannah, you honestly think Sharon's support is enough to sweep this under the rug? Get real. It won't. You owe Brinley an apology." She was sure Hannah was behind the video leak.

Hannah hadn't bothered glancing at the video. Her words were icy. "I have nothing to do with it."

"Only you had that video, Hannah. Who else could have leaked it?" Shrill and shaking, Brinley clung to Vincent's hand, tears streaking down her face."V/incent, now the world's seen me...Seen me harassed by two men. How am I supposed to live with that?"

Danica, all sympathy and outrage, dabbed away Brinley's tears."Don't you worry, sweetheart. We'll make sure Hannah pays for this."

A steely calm settled over Hannah. "Then show your evidence. If you're making accusations, at least present proof to me. Or is this how things are done now, shouting blame without a shred of evidence?"

That dismissive attitude sent Danica into a rage. "The only person with that video was you! Unless you're suggesting Brinley leaked that damn video herself? I know what's really going on: you're jealous that Vincent cares for her. You snapped and wanted payback. The Jones family shouldn't have let you marry in!"

Laughter, cold and humorless, escaped Hannah. "Bring me proof, or stop talking. Who gave you the right..."

She didn't get to finish. Vincent cut her off, his voice low and glacial. "Apologize."
###Chapter 41 The Police Showed Up


Vincent's eyes bore into Hannah, their intensity impossible to ignore. Derek had made it very clear over the phone-Brinley's harassment was somehow connected to Hannah. With the truth now on the table, there was no escaping the expectation-an apology was required.The Jones family prided itself on being just.

Confusion washed over Hannah. "Did I hear you right?"

Without hesitation, Vincent ordered, "Apologize to Brinley."

A quick spark of satisfaction lit up Brinley's face.

Danica couldn't hide her delight either.

"You actually doubt me?" Hannah's laugh was brittle. "You seriously think I leaked that video to the press?"

Unblinking, Vincent held her gaze. "This isn't only about the video. You owe her for what had happened at the club as well."

Standing tall behind Vincent, Brinley practicaly radiated victory. For her, Vincent's loyalty was a given.Now,he was proving it.

Pain seized Hannah's chest, and color drained from her cheeks. His accusations left deep marks, sharper than she expected. She had thought she'd built up enough scars to stop caring. Even so, Vincent's defense of Brinley still left her reeling.

Only after a long pause did Hannah find her voice again, quiet but determined. "Suppose I refuse. Then what?"

Disbelief crept into Vincent's voice. "You won't even admit to your own doing?"

Hannah's voice was cold as she met his stare."My own doing? You're already convinced I'm guilty without hearing my side of the story. I didn't do anything. And I won't admit to something I didn't do." Admitting to a crime she never committed made no sense at all.

Indifference filled Vincent's voice. "Derek has already investigated. Everything that had happened to Brinley at the club points straight to you."
Rather than defend herself any further, Hannah simply turned away and gave a low, humorless laugh.

Frustration broke through Danica's composure. "See for yourself, Vincent. Hannah won't even pretend to feel sorry!"

Tension in the air pressed in. With a gentle touch, Brinley reached for Vincent's sleeve, her words meant to solidify her gentle and forgiving image."Please, Vincent, there's no need to argue. Let's let this go. I'm not holding a grudge, now that everyone knows the truth. I just hope Hannah won't treat me like this again."

Vincent's scowl eased slightly. Brinley was always so understanding. Yet, the moment his eyes found Hannah again, they met nothing but quiet resistance. Firmness crept into his words. "No. I'm not letting this go."

For him,this was not an issue they could just brush aside. Hannah had to admit she was wrong.

Danica seized the moment."Exactly.Hannah owes Brinley an apology."

A harsh laugh escaped Hannah. "There's nothing for me to apologize for. If anyone should apologize, it's Brinley."

Lines of frustration appeared on Vincent's forehead. "Since when had you become like this?" He remembered a time when Hannah would own up to her mistakes. In his eyes, she had changed. Where was the woman who used to make things right after making some errors?

Hannah's gaze turned colder, sharper than before. Just like always, the moment she fell short of what he wanted, he dragged the past into the room and threw it in her face. "Nothing about me has changed. If you can't stand the person I am, then go ahead and divorce me. That way, you can finally be with your precious Brinley."

A dangerous glint flickered in Vincent's eyes as his jaw tensed, signaling the storm inside him.

Without warning, a piercing siren echoed from the street.

Into the room rushed a maid, breathless and wide-eyed. "Mr. Jones, the police are at thefront door."

A muscle in Vincent's jaw twitched as he shifted his gaze toward the hallway.

Excitement bubbled beneath Brinley's composed exterior. The police had made their entrance sooner than she'd hoped. Now Hannah had nowhere left to hide.
Feigning panic, Brinley clung to Vincent's arm. "Vincent, what should we do? I saw the video online and panicked. That's why I called the police. But now I'm worried... What if they arrest Hannah?"

Danica scoffed. "Why are you being so soft-hearted, Brinley? Let the police do their job. If Hannah gets locked up, it serves her right."

Vincent cast a look Hannah's way. Her composure held firm-she showed not the slightest hint of fear.

Within moments, the officers followed the maid into the foyer.

Brinley wasted no time stepping forward, voice trembling, eyes shining with practiced regret. "Officers, I'm so sorry. I want to take back my complaint. We settled everything. It was all a big misunderstanding. Please don't take Hannah away. I never meant for it to go this far."

Tears hovered on her lashes, her words quivering as if heartbreak weighed on her. Anyone watching might have believed Brinley and Hannah were lifelong friends.

Still, the police stayed detached. "Ma'am, please don't disrupt official proceedings."

One officer moved to the front. "We need to speak with Hannah Scott. Is she here?"

Before Hannah could utter a word, Vincent reached over and stopped her. Standing tall, he introduced himself. "I'm:her husband. If you have questions, direct them to me."
###Chapter 42 Weren't You Supposed To Arrest Hannah


Not hesitating for a moment, Hannah brushed off Vincent's hand and faced the officers. "I'm Hannah Scott."

Watching Vincent step in so quickly to protect Hannah, Brinley felt a twinge of annoyance. Still, she smothered her resentment and let a victorious smile settle in-what exquisite timing for the police to show up.

Danica looked like she could burst from delight. She even nudged Hannah with a playful push and said to the officers, "Yeah, that's her."

Hannah shifted slightly and locked eyes with Brinley, who shot her a challenging glare over.

One second, Brinley was smug, and the next, she transformed into a picture of nervous concern."Please,officers, don't take Hannah away. I've decided-I don't want to go through with pressing charges."

Danica, clearly displeased with this, raised her voice. "Oh, Brinley, why are you being so soft and forgiving?"

"If Sharon finds out about Hannah's arrest, she'll be upset." Mock defensiveness slipped into Brinley's tone as she clutched Vincent's hand. "Vincent, you have to do something. Please help Hannah."

A chill settled in Hannah's expression as she watched Brinley's performance. She knew Brinley couldn't wait to see her get taken away. As for Vincent, after what he'd just accused her of, she doubted he'd suddenly intervene for her.

"Ms. Scott, we'll need you to come with us," the officer remarked firmly.

Taking a steadying breath, Hannah nodded. "Alright. I'll cooperate."

Vincent stepped forward, gently patting her hand as a silent promise to stand by her side. "I'm going with her."

Noticing how Vincent held Hannah's hand, Brinley's expression chilled once more.

Panic flashed in Danica's eyes as she grabbed Vincent's arm. "Vincent, have you lost your mind? If the press finds out, it'll be a PR nightmare for the Jones Group!"

Vincent seemed ready to respond, but before he could say anything, Hannah calmly slipped her hand out of his grasp. Her voice was sharp and cold. "I don't need anyone to accompany me. I'm perfectly fine on my own. Officer, let's go."

Annoyance deepened the lines on Vincent's face as he watched her pull away with such distance. He hated that wall between them.

From the corner of the room, a second officer approached, a set of handcuffs ready in his hand.

Excitement flickered across Brinley's face. She could barely contain her joy at the thought of seeing those cuffs on Hannah's wrists.

But those cuffs never found their way to Hannah's wrists. A turn of events followed as the second officer addressed the group instead, "Can someone tell me which of you is Brinley Gilbert?"

Brinley stepped forward, confidence unshaken."That's me," she answered, thinking they might need her statement.

"Ms. Gilbert, you are now under investigation for encouraging harassment, manufacturing false accusations,and slander.Please come with us."

All color drained from Brinley's face."W-What do you mean?" This wasn't supposed to happen. Weren't the police after Hannah? A note of hysteria entered her voice. "There must be a mistake! I'm the one whofiled the report!"

The second officer said bluntly, "No mistake at all. After your complaint, we followed up and discovered clear evidence of your involvement. You fabricated events and framed Ms. Scott, seriously harming Ms.Scott's reputation. We have more than enough reason to bring you in."

Panic turned Danica's cheeks ashen. She hurried to Brinley's side and confronted the second officer."Wait,that can't be right! Weren't you supposed to arrest Hannah?"

The second officer's tone remained steady. "That was never the case. Ms. Scott reported what happened long before Ms. Gilbert did. After gathering the facts, it's clear Ms. Gilbert is responsible. She will be taken into custody."

Wild denial twisted Brinley's expression. "No! This is wrong! I didn't do any of it!"

Desperation sent Brinley searching for support. She turned to Vincent, but his attention never left Hannah.Grabbing for his sleeve, she begged, "Vincent, you have to believe me. I'm innocent-ths is a setup!"
Then, Brinley shot Hannah a glare full of accusation and fury.

One eyebrow raised, Hannah simply met Brinley's stare with a calm, unbothered challenge.Did Brinley really think she was the only one who would play games? Hardly.

Behind the scenes, Hannah had already brought in a private detective, keeping a close eye on every move.Once the news reached her that Brinley had tried to buy off those two men and shift the blame onto her,Hannah had wasted no time capturing the whole scheme on tape and passed the proof to the police. That decision was what set everything in motion and led to the scene unfolding now.

The officer moved to cuff Brinley.

With panic written all over her face, Brinley tried to back away. "No! I can't wear those! I haven't done anything wrong!"

Danica, unable to hide her outrage, blurted out, "You don't even have the facts straight! Why are you treating her like a criminal?"

A warning echoed in the officer's voice. "Please let us do our job. If you continue to interfere, we'll have no choice but to act."

In desperation, Brinley's gaze darted toward Vincent again. "Vincent, you have to trust me. I didn't do any of 计！＂	~

For a moment, Vincent's forehead creased. After a long breath, he placed a gentle hand on Brinley's shoulder, offering silent reassurance.

That small comfort seemed to settle Brinley, who stopped resisting as the cuffs were finally secured.

While the officers escorted her out, Brinley kept twisting around, eyes clinging to Vincent for some sign he would intervene.

Without delay, Danica gave Vincent a sharp nudge."Don't just stand there, Vincent. Go after her! There'sno way this isn't all a mistake. Brinley needs you-look at her!"

Vincent had just taken a step forward when a cold, scornful laugh escaped from Hannah. His jaw clenched as he paused for a moment. Then, without another word, he walked quickly after Brinley.
###Chapter 43 | Don't Want To Be Locked Up


Hannah stared blankly at the scene before her. For eight long years, she'd shared her life with Vincent.She once held onto the hope that pouring her heart into the relationship-never asking for anything in return-might be enough to win his affection.

But time had proven her wrong. All that loyalty and all those silent sacrifices had been wasted for nothing.What Vincent felt for her wasn't love. Whenever he looked her way, it was as though he was searching for someone else entirely.

And during her recent stay in the Jones estate, she'd bitterly felt that Vincent's attachment to Brinley stood out like a glaring spotlight. Every gentle word, every protective gesture, every ounce of his worry-he gave those to Brinley without hesitation.

Even when she faced the police, Vincent's concern had come off flat, as if he were reading lines from a script, putting on a show for appearances. His heart and worries always lay with Brinley, never her. She knew the truth now-Vincent wasn't incapable of love. He just didn't love her.

That realization had settled in Hannah's chest like an old bruise-painful at first, but eventually numb from the constant heartbreak.

A sharp pinch from Danica pulled Hannah back to the present.

"I always suspected you were the one behind this, Hannah. Framing Brinley just to get her locked up? That's quite vicious." Danica's glare sharpened as she snarled, "Did you really think this would drive a wedge between Brinley and Vincent? Dream on!"

Hannah winced from the pain and shot Danica a cold glare. "Rather than raising your voice at me, why don't you put that energy into finding a way to get Brinley out of jail?" Not backing down, she stepped forward,her tone steady and biting. "With charges like these, people can get locked away for at least a year, you know."

"You!" Danica's anger boiled over. She lifted her hand, ready to strike.

Lightning-fast, Hannah caught her wrist mid-swing and arched an eyebrow. "Did you really think I'd let you lay a hand on me again?"
A rough shove sent Danica stumbling backward, nearly losing her balance as she tried to recover.

Rage sent Danica's breath coming in sharp, ragged bursts as she fought to steady herself.

Without a second glance, Hannah strode toward the officers waiting forher, paying no attention to Danica's angry protests echoing behind her.

···

Brinley sat in the stark police station, searching for a loophole, grasping for any explanation that might clear her name. However, each denial sounded less convincing as the officers calmly presented their findings.

Still, Brinley refused to admit to her crime. "It wasn't me! That audio has to be doctored. I've never spoken those words. And why would I pay someone to assault myself?"

She clung to denial, refusing to budge an inch. The officers had grown tired of arguing, so they decided it was time for Brinley to meet the accomplices face-to-face.

The instant the two men entered, emotions flickered in their eyes. One of them grabbed her hand and begged, "Miss, please, get us out of here. We can't go to prison!"

Brinley shrank back, her eyes fixed on the floor. "I... I have no idea who you are."

Suddenly, one man's expression hardened. "You lying bitch! You were the one who told us to grope you,and now you're pretending you don't know us? If we're going down, you're coming with us!"

With a wild gesture, Brinley tried to shield herself. "Get them out of here! I swear, I've never met them in my life!"

As the men's emotions spun out of control, the officers had no choice but to separate them from Brinley.

Vincent stood off to the side, silent, but the lines across his forehead only deepened.

Desperation filled Brinley's voice. "They're framing me! I don't know them! They're the real criminals!"

One officer, unfazed, replied in a steady voice, "We've collected physical evidence and witness accounts.Right now, everything points straight to you."

Brinley avoided their eyes, panic flickering in her gaze.

The officer added, "You accused Ms. Scott of hiring someone to assault you, but in truth, you set up the entire thing yourself just to frame Ms. Scott. The charges are defamation and damaging someone's reputation. If this sticks, you could be facing a year behind bars. You may want to tell us the truth while you still have the chance."

Shock rooted Brinley to the spot. "What do you mean?" Her first instinct was to cling to Vincent's sleeve."Vincent, I'm begging you. Don't let them do this to me!"

The officer didn't even flinch. "Ms. Gilbert, pleading with others won't change your situation. The next step depends on the victim's wishes." He shifted his attention to Hannah."Ms. Scott, you're at the center of this.Do you want to reach a settlement, or would you rather press charges and see this through in court?"

"A settlement?" Hannah's gaze swept over to Brinley, and a chilling smnile touched her lips. "Absolutely not.An apology won't cut it either. I want Brinley Gilbert to be held accountable."

As she uttered the last sentence, she shifted and looked into Vincent's eyes.

Though Vincent said nothing, a faint shadow crossed his features.

Hannah noticed the tension right away. Clearly, Vincent wasn't thrilled about her answer. Still, she refused to let his feelings sway her. Back when she was wronged, she had no one on her side-only a chorus of accusations. This time, she wouldn't bend just because someone else didn't like her choice. She would demand her own justice, and she wouldn't back down.

Tears streamed down Brinley's face. "Vincent, please, I don't want to be locked up..."
###Chapter 44 He Pled On Brinley's Behalf


Vincent's features clouded over, tension gathering between his brows.

No reassurance came from Vincent, leaving Brinley cold with uncertainty. She took one last desperate chance. "Vincent, you don't believe me?"

A wall of silence met her plea. Vincent's eyes revealed nothing, his thoughts locked away.

Catching a glimpse of his profile, Hannah searched for a clue, but his expression stayed closed off.

Dread pooled in Brinley's stomach. Did this mean Vincent was giving up on her? Her voice cracked as she called out, "Vincent... Please..."

Authority rang through the officer's voice."Ms. Gilbert, you are sentenced to administrative detention.You'll be held for fifteen days."

No sooner had the officer spoken than two more approached to take Brinley by the arms.

Clutching her chest, Brinley gasped for breath. "Vincent, I can't breathe... My heart-it really hurts..."

Without warning, she crumpled to the floor.

Chaos erupted as everyonescrambled toward her.

Quick to react, Vincent swept her into his arms, voice shaking as he screamed, "To the hospital! Now!"

Never before had Hannah seen him look so utterly frantic. The fear in his eyes was a revelation.

In that moment, Hannah understood what set love apart from indifference. No tears came-she only pressed her lips together, numb as she observed the scene unravel.

A few minutes later, she finished her final statement and slipped out of the police station alone.

···

Flashing red lights carried them to Dorbarrow Hospital, where Brinley was whisked into emergency care.

The attending physician shot Vincent a hard stare. "She has a serious heart condition. Don't you know that?
Another two minutes, and we could've lost her."

Vincent stood as if turned to stone. He tried to process it. Brinley had been living with a heart condition all along? Suddenly, her previous words of being sick with no one by her side when she was abroad flashed back to his mind. So, she'd been plagued by this serious illness?

The doctor's tone left no room for argument. "You must protect her from any emotional distress. Her heart can't handle much more. You need to keep her calm at all times."

With a few more instructions rattled off, the doctor stepped away, leaving Vincent reeling.

Vincent lingered by the doorway, memories pulling him backward. He could see himself as a boy of seven,watching from the shore while the ocean claimed both Brinley's father and her brother. He could barely breathe as waves of self-reproach, remorse, and sorrow rose and fell, making it hard to stand his ground.

Hours slipped by while he stayed rooted there, lost in that tide of emotion.

When daylight finally crept through the blinds, Brinley woke and found Vincent right by her side. She struggled to speak. "Vincent, I-"

Vincent stopped her before she could say more. "Why did you keep your heart condition from me? This is serious. You should have told me."
2
She muttered, "I just didn't want you to worry. Most of the time, it's not so bad. As long as I stay calm, I can live a normal life."

His voice carried more weight than usual. "Heart disease isn't something to brush off. I'm calling a specialist. You're getting a more detailed reassessment, and we'll set up a treatment plan that works."

Her eyes flickered, and unease crept in. She hastily stopped him. "Please don't make me go through with that, Vincent. I don't want any treatment. I don't want to be separated from you. My father and brother are already gone... What if I don't survive the surgery?" Tears slipped down her cheeks.

Vincent's resolve softened as he watched her cry. "Then focus on feeling better for now. If things get worse,have a specialist check on you."

A bit of relief flickered across Brinley's face as she agreed. "Alright." Her fingers trembled as she reached for his, "Vincent, please believe me-l was set up. I really don't know those two men. I would never do anything to damage my own name."
He hesitated and then gently pulled away. "Let me handle this. You just concentrate on getting better."

A faint smile crossed her lips. "Alright. I promise, I'Il take care of myseIf. You don't have to worry."

Vincent offered a quiet nod, not quite meeting her eyes. When he finished giving her a few last reminders,he left her to rest.

Not long after, Derek sent Vincent a message. "Mr. Jones, should we keep digging?"

Vincent sent a quick reply. "Stop. That's enough."

Vincent knew sorting out Brinley's situation meant he had to begin with Hannah. His first move was to call her.


Meanwhile, at home, Hannah was focused on finalizing details for Sharon's birthday party plan. The moment Vincent's name appeared on her phone, she hit decline without missing a beat. A second call came through,but she rejected it again, just as quickly. Her solution to his ongoing calls was to silence her phone altogether.

Minutes later, Vincent stormed back and appeared at her doorway, his patience frayed. "Why wouldn't you answer me?"

"I just didn't want to." Hannah didn't even look up from her work.

He leaned against the frame of the doorway, exhaustion dragging at his features. His words were strained from lack of sleep. "We need to talk."

Her eyes flickered with annoyance. "What is there left to say? It's about Brinley, isn't it?"

With less edge in his tone, Vincent tried to reason with her. "She's already admitted she made a mistake."

Hannah rolled her eyes. Of course, it was about Brinley. A humorless chuckle escaped her. "What,now she needs you to apologize on her behalf?"

Vincent didn't respond to the jab, choosing instead to cut to the chase."L_et's just drop this whole thing."
###Chapter 45 He Stepped In For Her


"Drop this whole thing?" Hannah snapped her laptop shut. "Not a chance. Whatever happens between you and Brinley is none of my business. But after what she did, twisting the facts and dragging my name through the mud, I'm taking this as far as it needs to go. If it calls for prosecution, then so be it."

Vincent worked at the knot of his tie, his eyes cool. "I'll make it up to you. You've been eyeing my mother's properties, right? I'll get them for you. I don't care how many units you want."

A short, dry laugh slipped from Hannah. "How generous of you."

She had to admit Brinley really was Vincent's irreplaceable first love-no amount of money was too much if it meant protecting her.

With arms crossed, Hannah shook her head. "I'm not interested in money or those properties."

Vincent's frown deepened as her refusal hung in the air. "My mind's made up," he said, his words leaving no room for argument. "I'll have the charges withdrawn in your name."

"Don't you dare!" Hannah hadn't expected him to be so high-handed about it.

"I have .Derek handle it. This ends now." With that, Vincent turned and left.

But Hannah had no intention of letting it slide. She compiled all the evidence and submitted it directly to the court.

Not long after, Brinley, still lying in a hospital bed, received the court's official summons. All color drained from her face, shock written plainly in her eyes.

Danica breezed in right then to check on her. Seeing Brinley's stricken look, she hurried to the bedside."Brinley, are you feeling worse? Is your heart acting up?"

Trembling,Brinley held out the paper, tears smudging the ink. "Mrs. Jones, look what Hannah's done. She's determined to ruin me."

Outrage flashed across Danica's face. "She's actually suing you? She has no shame!"

Determined to help, Danica flattened the court summons on the table and reached for her phone. "Give me a second. I'll send this to Vincent right away. He needs to know how Hannah's treating you."

Masking her glee, Brinley pressed her lips together. "Maybe we shouldn't let Vincent know about this."

"You always take the gentle route, Brinley. Sometimes I wish you wouldn't," Danica said.

A moment later, Danica tapped her phone, sending the snapshot of the court summons straight to Vincent.

Brinley felt a rush of satisfaction-just a few tears and a few words, and someone was already fighting for her.

Vincent's call came through almost at once.

With a slight smile, Danica tilted the phone so Brinley could see. "Look at that. He called the second he saw the message."

Happiness crept across Brinley's face.

Without missing a beat, Danica picked up. Vincent's voice carried through the speaker. "How's Brinley doing?"

Danica wasted no time. "Here, you can speak to her yourseIf," she said, passing the phone to Brinley.

Brinley took the phone without hesitation.

His concern was obvious as he asked, "Is your heart still hurting?"

"Not anymore," Brinley answered instantly. "I just got that court summons, and it rattled me a little."

"Leave it to me. I'll take care of everything," Vincent remarked, his tone gentle.

"Thank you, Vincent," she replied softly.

Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Vincent hung up and instantly dialed Hannah's number.

This time, she picked up almost instantly.

"She's gotten the court summons, I take it?" Hannah's voice was almost breezy.

"Areyou really going through with this lawsuit?" Vincent asked.

Her answer didn't waver. "I am." After a pause, Vincent finally spoke, quieter this time. "Brinley's health isn't good. She's got a heart condition."


For a moment, silence stretched between them before Hannah found her voice again. "Vincent, if being sick was all it took to avoid facing the consequences, this world wouldn't be able to uphold justice. She dragged my name through the dirt first-don't I get to defend myself? Her health isn't my responsibility. Just because she's fragile doesn't mean I owe her mercy. If you're hoping I'll let it go out of pity, then I'm afraid I can't do that."

Unwavering and cool, her tone never slipped. She ended the call without hesitation right after.

Having resolved the legal matter-at least for the moment-Hannah felt lighter. Turning her attention to business, she began chatting with event organizers about Sharon's birthday banquet. In the middle of their conversation, her phone buzzed with unexpected news-the court had tossed out her case.

Stunned, she called to ask for answers-only to learn that Vincent had interfered. Anger boiled over, and she fired off a message to him. "You shameless bastard."

She started reaching out to courts in other regions, hoping one might hear her out. But every single one turned her away, calling the case "exceptional" and refusing to take it on. It was obvious now. Vincent was shielding Brinley from the consequences.

Hannah lowered her phone, her energy drained and her hope running low. With Vincent in the picture, there was no way Brinley would ever be prosecuted.

Hannah shifted her approach. She sent Vincent another message."1fyou want me to drop the lawsuit, fine.But Brinley has to post a public apology. Put it online where everyone can see. Do that, and I'll step away.lf not, I'll keep filing. Every single day. I've got time, and I'm not afraid to use it. And if the media catches wind of this-let's see who ends up being publicly disgraced."

Vincent didn't reply.

Later, as Hannah scrolled through Instagram, something caught her eye and made her freeze. Brinley had posted again-just one minute earlier.

The post had three photos. A man in a suit, seen from behind; a hand pointing toward him; a massive bouquet of red roses. The caption read, "The man I love came to see me again. And he brought me these beautiful flowers."
###Chapter 46 You Think You've Won


Seeing Brinley's post, Hannah understood now. No wonder Vincent hadn't responded to her message. He had been with Brinley in the hospital all along. No surprise there. The instant his precious first love ran into trouble, the legendary CEO turned into her savior. He dropped everything to rush to her side,taking care of every little detail himself.

Then, Hannah's mind shifted to her own miscarriage. Back when she lost their baby, Vincent hadn't visited her in the hospital even once. She could taste the bitterness, but she forced herself to swallow it. It was fine.She didn't want a man like him anymore anyway. A smirk, sharp and icy, flickered across her lips.

Just then, Felix sent over several documents.

Hannah steadied herself and threw all her focus into the task in front of her. The hours passed without making a sound. When she finally glanced up, her screen lit up with call after call she hadn't noticed until now. All of them were from Vincent. Predictable. Any threat to Brinley sent him spiraling.

Her ringtone cut through the silence. She answered, taking her time,"Well? Have you made up your mind?"

She kept her tone steady as she continued, "I want Miss Gilbert's public apology at eight o'clock tonight.Don't be late."

A faint,pleading voice drifted through the speaker. Brinley's. "Vincent..."

So they were still together. Hannah's finger hovered over the hang-up button, but then Vincent's voice interrupted, low and edged with warning. "Hannah."

Hannah let out an impatient sigh. "What is it now?"

"Brinley has a heart condition. Don't provoke her again."

Rolling her eyes, Hannah let out a chuckle. "Vincent, maybe you should save your advice for your precious Brinley. If she's truly unwell, she'd do better focusing on her health instead of popping up in my life."

Then, she ended the call, not giving him a chance to respond. She lamented that she should have hung up the second he uttered her name.

After reviewing Felix's documents, inspiration struck Hannah. If they were moving forward with a smart bracelet for women, why not center it around hormone monitoring? Giving women the tools to trulyknow their own bodies felt like the right direction. She immediately shared this idea to Felix.

Not pausing for a moment, Hannah turned her attention to planning Sharon's upcoming birthday bash.

From the way the estate would be arranged, to the playlist for the string quartet, to the color of the invitation borders and the style of each floral brooch, Hannah's eye made sure every last detail was flawless. There were just twelve days left before she walked away from Vincent's life altogether. In these final days at the Jones estate, she.was determined to give Sharon a birthday she'd never forget.

Right on the dot at 8 p.m., Brinley's public apology went live on every platform, reaching Hannah.

Since the law couldn't hold Brinley accountable, Hannah decided to let public opinion take over.

Brinley's so-called apology barely qualified. She tagged Hannah and wrote, "Sorry." She didn't bother with an explanation, skipped any context, and refused to admit to anything. That single word seemed to be all she felt was required.

Feeling triumphant, Brinley dropped a message into Hannah's inbox. "Hannah, do you really think you've won?"

Hannah didn't reply. She took a screenshot and reposted Brinley's apology with it attached. The caption read,"?"

Vincent chimed in almost immediately underneath, posting the same cryptic symbol,"?".

Vincent was obviously jumping in to shield Brinley, but Hannah paid him no mind.

Before long, their little showdown lit a fire under social media, and #JonesGroup climbed straight into the trending charts.

Nothing drew attention quite like a scandal among the rich, and people everywhere were hooked.

Word spread like wildfire once people began poking around. Suddenly, everyone was caught up in the chaos -Vincent's first love and his current"mistress" were apparently locked in a public tug-of-war over him. The gossip mill couldn't get enough, spinning tales about his tangled relationships and the drama swirling between these two women.

Yet, sharper eyes quickly pieced together what was really going on. As it turned out, Vincent's first love had gone so far as to fake a harassment scene and aimed to throw the blame on his "mistress."
And that "mistress" wasn't one to take things lying down. The moment trouble surfaced, she'd marched right over to the police and filed a report.

As a result, the first love had been forced into the awkward spotlight, making a public apology. There was no real remorse,though. She'd typed out a single"sorry" and left it at that. The "mistress" had decisively decided to share the smug private message she'd received for every netizen to see.

Before long, the internet erupted. Brinley's apology post exploded, racking up over half a million comments,and the vast majority were scathing.

Faced with a flood of backlash, Brinley disabled the comments in frustration.

On the flip side, Hannah's repost turned into a rallying cry. Support poured in from every corner. People called hertotal inspiration" and "the queen who never settles for less." Her follower count skyrocketed by more than half a million.

One comment shot to the top: "Ditch Vincent already! Come to me instead. I've got energy, looks, and I'll never let you down in any way."

That comment had Hannah cracking up, so she dropped a like on it.

Meanwhile, sitting inside the Bentley, Derek scrolled through the flood of comments, a grin tugging at his lips.

Vincent slid into the car just then. The grin on Derek's face did not go unnoticed. "What's so funny?"Vincent asked, keeping his tone even.

"You have to see this. The comment section of your wife's repost is something else today," Derek said,holding his phone out with a little flourish.

With just one glance, Vincent immediately caught the comment that Hannah had just liked.

Before Vincent could really focus on it, Derek's finger kept flicking the screen, moving past that top comment.


"Go back," Vincent said, his words sharp,

Flustered, Derek nodded. "Right away."

Hannah's like had pushed that comment to the top, making it impossible to miss.
Vincent's eyes narrowed, his whole expression turning cold in an instant.

Sensing the shift, Derek slipped his phone away and scrambled to buckle up. He cleared his throat and asked with caution, "Should we go see Miss Gilbert at the hospital now?"
###Chapter 47 You'd Really Dump MeFor Someone Like That
"Go home." Vincent's tone was as cold as ever.


Derek grumbled silently to himself. Vincent practically lived at the hospital these days, and people might start thinking he'd moved in for good.


Right then, Vincent's phone buzzed. Brinley's name flashed on the screen. He picked up without delay."Vincent..." Her voice shook, barely holding it together. "Everyone online is tearing me apart. I can't handle this. I'm not the villain they make me out to be."


Vincent could hear her quick, shallow breaths through the line. His voice grew gentler. "Try to stay calm.I'll handle it."


A tiny, broken plea slipped out. "Will you still visit me?"
 "I'll see you tomorrow." He offered a few more comforting words before ending the call. He then pressed his fingers to the bridge of his nose, trying to focus. "Derek, leak some juicy celebrity news to the press. Distract them from Brinley. And start filing lawsuits against anyone posting defamatory comments."


Unable to read Vincent's expression, Derek quietly responded, "Got it."


Vincent cracked the window, letting the wind in. The breeze cleared his head, if only a little.


Back at the Jones estate, Hannah finished up her work around ten and slipped away to the bathroom for a shower.


Stepping out of the bathroom wrapped in just a towel, Hannah froze, her heart skipped a beat.Vincent stood there, leaning against the doorframe,as silent as a shadow.


"So, you finally decided to leave the hospital?" she said, her voice laced with sarcasm. She hadn't seenI him at home for three days, but she'd seen his face plastered all over Brinley's social media every single day.


"I camne straight from work," Vincent replied, his tone as chilly as ever.


Hannah just shrugged, her words flat. "Oh." She couldn't care less where he returned from.


Vincent's gaze sharpened. "What's with those comments online?"



Hannah blinked. So, he'd shown up just to confront her over the screenshot she'd shared of Brinley's private message. Naturally, he showed up to defend Brinley.


Hannah's jaw tightened. "You've seen it. Was there any point coming all this way just to ask?"


Yes, she'd posted that screenshot deliberately.Making Brinley feel utterly humiliated was exactly what she wanted. So what if it was petty?


Vincent's hand shot out, catching her at the waist,
 his expression impossible to read. "You were serious?"



She tried to break herself free, knee flying up in a sharp warning, but he dodged and trapped her,pressing his leg between hers.


"Damn right I was." Hannah shot back, refusing to back down. It seemed Brinley had him completely wrapped around her finger. All it took was one post,and he was storming back, ready to pick a fight on her behalf.


The longer Hannah stared at Vincent, the more she felt sick to her stomach.



"Young, energetic, won't let you down in any department?' Is that really your type? You'd really dump me for someone like that?" Vincent's jaw clenched as his mind flashed back to the top comment he'd seen online.



"What are you talking about?" Hannah blinked in confusion.Then it hit her-he must've seen the top comment she'd liked on that post. So he wasn't here to defend Brinley afer all?


Hannah's mind whirled, her irritation momentarily replaced by confusion.


While she was still piecing things together, Vincent suddenly leaned down and bit her on the collarbone,almost as if to punish her. "You're trying to drive me insane," he said, voice low and rough.


"Ow!" Hannah hissed, pressing her hands against his chest to create some distance. "Are you insane?"


She fought to break free, twisting in his embrace.


But Vincent wasn't about to let her go. With one swift motion, he pinned her wrists above her head,the cool metal of his cufflinks pressing into her skin.


She jerked back instinctively, trying to put space between them.


But Vincent wasn't finished. Hle grabbed her by the waist and lifted her, setting her down on the vanity. "Vincent, what do you think you're-" Her protest was cut short as he crashed his mouth onto hers, the kiss hard and possessive.


He bit down on her lower lip until shetasted blood,the sharp tang spreading between them.


That was enough. Hannah shoved him off with all her strength, wiping her lips and shooting him a look of disgust. "If you want sex, go crawl back to Brinley.Get the hell away from me!"
 
###Chapter 48 Just Divorce Me Already
A dark storm gathered in Vincent's eyes. "Don't bring up Brinley," he snapped, voice as cold as ice. The warning in his tone was unmistakable. "She would never speak to me the way you do."


Only silence followed until Hannah broke it with a bitter, mocking laugh, retreating a step. "If that's the case, go to her. What's the point of coming boack here at all?"



Vincent's expression tightened, lines deepening between his brows. "Is it really necessary for you to talk like this?"


Sharp defiance glinted in Hannah's eyes. "I've always talked like this. If you can't take it, just divorce me already."


A look of fury flashed across his face. "How many times do I have to tell you? Don't bring up divorce again."
He studied her, noticing the way she seemed fixated on ending things lately.


Turning away, Hannah made it clear she was done arguing.


A flick of his cuffs signaled his impatience as he shifted topics. "What you did with Brinley-don't let it happen again. Your post could make her condition worse."



Arms folded, Hannah's laugh was hollow and sharp.She had just believed he wasn't here to defend Brinley. How foolish of her. Of course, everything came back to Brinley. That was always the reason.Vincent had only come home to defend Brinley. The truth stung-to him, she was just a stand-in, never the real thing.


Anger twisted inside Hannah, threatening to spill over. Why did she have to suffer just because Brinley was sick?



A hard, unflinching smile broke across Hannah's face. "Vincent, let's get one thing straight. Brinley apologized to me. And what I say in response to that apology is none of your business."


A muscle in Vincent's jaw jumped, his eyes darkening further."And you had to pick a fight with her on the internet?"



"Think whatever you want," Hannah replied, voice icy. His disapproval was obvious, but she didn't care.She wasn't going to back down.


Tension pressed in from all sides until Vincent's phone abruptly began to ring.


A sideways glance from Hannah caught the name flashing on the screen-Brinley.


Without a second's hesitation, Vincent answered,his tone softening instantly. On the other end, Brinley's sweet, trembling voice complained of feeling unwell and wanting to see him as soon as possible.


Vincent glanced at Hannah.


Hannah nodded as she thought she got his message.

She started to walk out of the room.
But abruptly, Vincent stepped in before she could go any farther. He grabbed her wrist, refusing to let her slip away. She pulled and twisted, trying to break loose, but his grip held firm.


Left with no choice, Hannah endured the next thirty minutes listening to Vincent's low, soothing words as he comforted Brinley-every phrase another twist of the knife.


When the call ended, Hannah finally managed to wrench her arm away with force. Rubbing the angry red mark on her wrist, she glared at him. "Whatever goes on between you and Brinley is your business.I don't care."



Vincent's gaze flicked to her wrist, now visibly red.A brief shadow crossed his face. Silence hung for a moment before his voice dropped to something almost gentle. "Delete that post."


Hannah blinked, taken aback. Was he really asking this now?



Stern lines deepened around Vincent's mouth. "I just But abruptly, Vincent stepped in before she could go any farther. He grabbed her wrist, refusing to let her slip away. She pulled and twisted, trying to break loose, but his grip held firm.

Stern lines deepened around Vincent's mouth. "I just got word-Brinley's heart rate spiked because of the comment section of your post. If anything happens to her, you'll be the one to blame. Delete the post."


A defiant spark lit in Hannah's eyes. "No. I won't delete it," she replied, voice steady and strong. This was justice she fought for-no way in hell was she backing down now.


Vincent's jaw tightened. "Brinley has already apologized. Isn't that enough for you?"


"Not nearly enough," Hannah replied, folding her arms tightly. "A single apology won't fix what she did."



A thick silence grew between them, bristling with resentment.



Then, without warning, Vincent lunged forward and snatched her phone right off the vanity.


Hannah darted forward, voice sharp. "What do you think you're doing?"


But he had the height advantage. One arm easily held her back as he unlocked her phone with practiced ease. Within seconds, he located the post and deleted it without hesitation.


The phone was thrust back into her hand, his words cutting and final. "It's gone."


For a moment, Hannah was too stunned to move.Then,fury overtook her, and she kicked him hard in the shin. "You had no right! That wasn't yours!"


Rage made her whole body shake as she struggled to catch her breath.


Vincent's eyes slid away, his tone flat and distant."This ends now."


Calm on the surface, his words sliced right through her.


Refusing to break, Hannah tipped her head back,willing the tears not to fall-not ove him.


A tense swallow was the only sign of his discomfort.After a heavy pause, he said, "I'll transfer the Lakeshore Villa into your name."
"Like I want it," she replied. Her voice was cool,detached.


Turning away, she made for the door-but Vincent's grip landed on her wrist again. "It's settled, then."


No room for argument lingered in the air. The meaning was clear: this was nothing more than a transaction. Another attempt to solve everything with money.


That was always Vincent's way-gift-wrapped solutions, money in place of real apologies. Once, it had been jewelry or handbags. Now, it wasproperty,meant to buy Hannah's silence about Brinley.


Weariness replaced the anger in Hannah's chest. If this was how he wanted to end things, by paying her off, she'd take it. After everything, he owed her at least that much. She drew herself up, eyes fierce and unyielding. "Then make it cash. I want nothing with your name on it."


A tug at his loosened tie was his only reaction."Fine."
No further words passed between them as Vincent walked out the door, destination obvious.


She knew exactly where he was going. But she didn't have the energy to care. He always sought Brinley out.


A glance at her phone showed the hour: midnight.Eleven days remained. After that, she would leave his world entirely.
###Chapter 49 A Photo Of Them Kissing
Once Hannah slipped into her pajamas, she clicked into the legal documents her attorney had emailed,diving into every page with a careful eye. She had asked for legal advice specifically regarding her dispute with Brinley.


Just as she was fully absorbed in the document,her phone buzzed with breaking news alerts.


"Jones Group Files Massive Lawsuit-Is All for the Sake of a First Love?"



"Major Twist-CEO's Alleged Mistress Erases Her Post in Shame?"



Hannah couldn't quite describe the feeling that rose in her chest. Numb, she tapped into the sea of comments below the headline.



Only two hours back, a swarm of strangers had come to her defense. But now, those same voices hurled insults. They called her shameless. Labeled her a gold digger. Accused her of chasing wealth just for appearances.


Nothing about their judgment fazed Hannah. Worse had been said right to her face by people in Vincent's circle.



Back on the trending tab, she saw that every trace of her spat with Brinley had quietly disappeared. No wonder Vincent was so eager to compensate her.The villa offer and the sudden generosity all served one purpose: smoothing things over for this moment.



Laughter sat on the edge of her lips, but no sound came. Scrolling further, she spotted a grainy paparazzi photo-Brinley and Vincent, caught in a kiss.



Even with her heart locked away, Hannah felt it stumble. Time and again, Vincent had claimed there was nothing between him and Brinley. Still, one look at that intimate photograph was enough to unravel every assurance he'd given.
Suddenly, it all made sense-why V/incent insisted on keeping their marriage under wraps. He had always loved Brinley. He only ever wanted to go public with Brinley. Being the secret spouse meant she was never meant for the spotlight. She was the hidden ###Chapter.Easily erased.


Without a word,Hannah pressed save on the photo.


Throughout the night, sleep refused to come, no matter how many times she closed her eyes.


Maybe it was the flood of posts and comments she'd read. Old memories mingled with fresh wounds,dragging her mind back to her earlier days with Vincent. While she'd been the understudy in his story, there had been sweet moments.


The night Vincent proposed, he had transformed a glass conservatory with a sea of yellow roses-her favorite.


There had been a time when he'd mark her calendar,cancel business flights across the world,simply because she begged him to stay. He'd pull her close,
pressing his palms to her aching stomach and trying to soothe the pain.


Six months into their marriage, they had moved into their new home, Lakeshore Villa, miles from the Jones family estate, all to protect her from Danica's spite. At the doorway, Vincent had remarked, "This is our home." That simple line... It was the most heartfelt thing he'd ever said to her.


During the first year in their new home, he'd bring her fresh flowers every night he came home.She'd saved most of them, letting them dry until they became keepsakes of something gentle.


Spare hours had brought spontaneous tripS-snowfall in winter, shimmering lakes in summer.


In moments of passion, he'd pull her close, call her "baby" or "Anna," and insist on exploring every way they could be close.


Unfortunately, happiness had slipped away far too soon. Vincent's schedule had grown increasingly packed, and his presence at home had gradually become a rare occurrence.


There were days when Hannah searched every room,only to discover he was gone. Maybe that was when Brinley came back into the picture. Perhaps that was when Vincent's attention drifted for good. The substitute had served her purpose, and he was done pretending.


Looking back, Hannah could only taste the ache of old memories. Maybe the only reason he'd ever treated her well was because he saw someone else in her. Real or fake, the truth felt impossible to untangle. Who could say how much of his past affection had actually belonged to her?


Sleep barely touched Hannah that night, with thoughts tumbling endlessly through her mind.Exhaustion clung to her by sunrise, leaving her heavy-eyed and hollow.


Downstairs, the dining room buzzed with Danica's laughter as she scrolled her phone, nibbling at her breakfast as if nothing in the world could bother her.
With a bright grin, Danica pressed play on Brinley's voice message for all to hear. "That's a relief, Brinley.Vincent must really care about you," she said, her voice full of delight.


Catching sight of Hannah on the staircase, Danica's smile disappeared, her eyes sharpening with contempt. "So you actually managed to sleep while the whole internet tore you apart?"


Hannah shot Danica a sideways glance and asked the housekeeper for some porridge. Her tone was calm as she replied to Danica. "Why would that be your concern?"


"That's the attitude you're going with?" Danica snapped, smacking her spoon against the table.


Pointing an accusing finger, Danica's voice grew shrill. "If Brinley hadn't told me, I'd never have known how low you'd sink! Airing out private messages online, just to make yourself look better? Have you no shame?"

 
Last night, Danica had gone to bed early and missed all the online drama, only to wake up and find Brinley the sudden darling of public opinion. Eager for the story, she'd immediately called Brinley and gotten an earful about Hannah's so-called manipulations.


Meeting Danica's triumphant stare, Hannah answered with a cold glare of her own, "If anyone here should be ashamed, it's Brinley. Not me."

###Chapter 50 The Woman BehindVictoria Hale
"You-" Danica's eyes turned stormy for a moment,but she covered it up with a strained grin. "Let's not pretend, because everyone can see who the real embarrassment is. Hannah, you're the one getting blasted online right now."


Danica flashed her nails, still glowing from a recent polish, and her voice dripped with satisfaction. "It was smart of me to keep your marriage to Vincent under wraps. Can you imagine the chaos for the Jones Group if word got out? Vincent must regret marrying you more than anything. I've never figured out what he saw in you. Your family never brought anything valuable to the table."


In Danica's eyes, Brinley was exceptional. Brinley had grown up under her careful supervision, carrying both beauty and a strong academic background.
Even after leaving the country for a time following that incident, Brinley was back now and easing into important roles within a subsidiary. It was only a matter of time before Brinley officially joined the Jones family.


Looking at Danica's face full of contempt and hearing that condescending tone, Hannah suddenly lost her appetite. In the past, she'd always kept quiet around Danica, refusing to stir up trouble-but not anymore.


Hannah slapped her spoon onto the table and retorted, "If you've always looked down on me,maybe you should've done more than sit back and watch me marry into this family. Or were you just too powerless to do anything about it?"


A flush crept up Danica's cheeks. She threw her spoon at Hannah, blinded by rage.


Hannah shifted easily, dodging the attack. She knew exactly where Danica's sore spot was. Even though Danica was Vincent's mother, losing her husband early had left her without any real say in the Jones household.

With Sharon doting on Hannah, Danica never had anyone on her side, no matter how much she tried.


"You mad now?" Hannah sneered. "Then let me really give you something to scream about."


A new edge crept into her voice. "I know you've been delaying the transfer of the remaining seven properties to me, and my patience is gone. If those properties aren't in my name by tonight, I'll rip up the divorce agreement while Vincent watches."


Danica shot up from her seat and slapped her palms on the table. "You won't dare!"


With a casual flick, Hannah sent the spoon flying,splattering soup all over Danica's expensive scarf.She gave Danica a smug grin, "Test me."


Remaining completely unbothered, Hannah calmly wiped her hands, settled back in her chair,and started eating the warm porridge at her own pace,never breaking eye contact with Danica.


At exactly ten in the morning, Hannah walked through the doors of Nova Tech.


Inside the glass-walled conference room, she delivered a clear and enthusiastic presentation about the hormone-monitoring wristband, explaining its key features, the opportunities in the market, and her plan for seamless integration.


She had hoped her pitch would open the floor for ideas and discussion. Instead, awkward silence filled the room. Everyone just stared at her until one of the men broke in. "Did a gold-digger really come here to pitch us something serious?"


Another man raised his voice above the rest. "We don't need some CEO's mistress playing around at a tech company. If you don't have any real skills, don't waste our time."


Originally just bystanders to the internet drama, the employees of Nova Tech had pieced it all together when one of the coders traced the online scandaI to none other than their newly installed CEO,Hannah Scott. From there, the office atmosphere had gone from tense to explosive.
Felix tried to jump in, but Hannah silenced him with a simple gesture and addressed the team herself, her tone icy and composed, "Since you're all so interested in my personal life, I'll set the record straight. I graduated at the top of my class, with honors, and a stack of awards from competitions.What actually counts, though, are results-not empty words."



She waited for her words to register. "About this project, let's be honest. Everyone here has been tossing around ideas for days, but nothing impressive has come up yet. Meanwhile, I thought up the hormone-monitoring wristband in a single evening. If you want to question someone's skills,maybe you should look elsewhere."


The silence in the room grew heavier. Not a whisper broke through. Felix's gaze landed on Hannah,admiration plain on his face. Hannah, the founder of this company, was truly remarkable. Intelligent,confident, and never one to back down from a challenge.

If the team ever learned that Hannah was actually "Victoria Hale," the mysterious pioneer who brought women's safety products to market, they'd be floored. She was the mind behind the famous ultrasonic self-defense earrings, which had sold out again and again. Her work had developed a near-cult following.


Still, Hannah preferred to stay out of the spotlight.Even with her return, she had no plans to use her old name for recognition, nor did she want to reveal that she was the founder of Nova Tech. What mattered most to her now was starting over and building her own reputation.


Once the meeting ended, everyone jumped straight into an energetic discussion. The wristband's core features took shape as they began to outline the next phase, turning their ideas into a working prototype.


Felix's worried eyes flickered to Hannah. "Are you alright?"


She gave a reassuring nod. "I'm fine. Nothing they said bothered me. When we started working on the women's safety products, we had dealt with criticism and resistance that was a hundred times worse. This feels easy compared to that." A wide smile brightened her face as she gently patted Felix's shoulder.


That smile brought warmth to her whole expression.Felix found himself quietly mesmerized.


A sudden ring from her phone broke the moment.The call came from an unfamiliar number.


Hannah answered and stiffened at the sound of a recognizable voice. "Ms. Scott, your parents show up at the Jones Group. Don't you think you should do something about it?"


She remembered the speaker-Vincent's assistant,Clive Monroe.Worry hit her all at once. Her parents must have seen something on the internet and marched over to the Jones Group to confront Vincent. There had never been a formal introduction between them. The only thing she had ever shared with them was his picture.

###Chapter 51 That's Our Son-in-law

Documents in hand, Clive made his way downstairs,intending only to hand them off to Vincent. The sight of a middle-aged couple hovering near the lobby desk barely registered at first, until their voices drifted over, boldly declaring Vincent as their son-in-law.


A phone was waved in the air by the man, who pointed at the screen with earnest conviction."That's our daughter's husband. Vincent Jones."


Curiosity got the better of Clive, so he took a closer look. The photo turned out to be nothing but a basic headshot, hardly proof of anything. He had to stifle a laugh at their nerve. Some people would go to any lengths just to cozy up to someone important.


While the receptionist tried to stay polite, her patience was wearing thin. "I'm sorry, you'll need an appointment if you want to see Mr. Jones."


Refusing to take no for an answer, the couple dug in their heels and kept insisting.


Clive noticed the growing tension and decided to put an end to it. Stepping forward, he flashed his work pass with authority. "I've dealt with your type before," he said, voice cold and crisp. "Spread another lie about our CEO, and we'll drag you into court."



Rising indignation flared in the middle-aged woman's eyes. "We're not making this up! Vincent really is our son-in-law. Our daughter married him!"


Disbelief flickered across Clive's face. "That can't be.Mr. Jones isn't married. What wife are you talking about?"



Shocked, the middle-aged man nearly dropped his phone. "What? That's impossible! Our daughter even showed us her marriage certificate!"



Desperately scrolling, he found the photo he wanted and thrust it toward Clive. "Look, this is real! They got married for sure!"

A quick glance at the image stopped Clive cold.There, on the digitalcertificate, he saw two names:Hannah Scott and Vincent Jones.


Recognition dawned on Clive, and a few pieces finally snapped together. So Hannah was their daughter. All at once, the ugly truth took shape.She'd spun a web of lies for her parents-pretending to be Vincent's wife, faking a marriage certificate,and selling the fantasy that she was anything more than a shameless mistress.



Clive couldn't begin to understand what Vincent ever saw in Hannah. Vanity and manipulation defined every move she made. No explanation seemed good enough.


Not even a day had passed since Hannah stirred up an online scandal, going after Brinley out of sheer jealousy, only to retreat and delete the evidence in the dead of night. All morning, the secretarial staff buzzed about the drama, and now Clive found himself standing right in the middle of yet another mess.
With a short laugh, Clive brushed off the couple's presence and fired off a message to Derek,requesting Hannah's contact information. Seconds after Derek replied, he dialed Hannah's number without a second thought. His tone cold,he taunted,"Ms. Scott, your parents are here at the Jones Group. It's about time you dealt with them, don't you think?"


Not waiting for a reply, Clive ended the call abruptly.Before he could break the truth to the couple, the familiar sight of Vincent's car turning into the driveway caught his eye. The car window rolled down, revealing his face.


Stepping forward, Clive quickly passed the documents to Vincent. Sitting in the passenger seat,Brinley caught his eye and flashed a warm smile,while Vincent barely paused to skim the papers before signing his name.


Papers handed back, Vincent glanced in the direction of the lobby but didn't linger, uninterested in the commotion.
Brinley, more observant, pointed discreetly. "There's a couple over there who can't stop staring at us."


A smooth answer rolled off Clive's tongue. "They're probably just awestruck by how photogenic you both are."



Her laughter came easily, a soft blush coloring her cheeks. "You're such a charmer."


Knowing Vincent and Brinley were heading abroad for a vacation and choosing not to spoil the light mood, Clive kept quiet about Hannah's parents and their wild claims.



Across the lobby, Hannah's parents, Raymond Scott and Margaret Scott, waited anxiously. As the car window rolled down, both caught a clear glimpse of Vincent. Margaret's eyes widened. "That's him!That's our son-in-law!"



Eager, the pair hurried after the vehicle, but it was already cruising away before they reached it.


Clive stepped forward to block their path, putting himself between them and any hope of pursuit.


Margaret turned to her husband, clutching his sleeve in excitement. "Did you see? Our daughter really has good taste. He's even more handsome than in the photos."


A pleased nod from Raymond followed as he adjusted his glasses. "He certainly is."


Curiosity turned to hope as Raymond faced Clive."When will Vincent be back?"


A scoff escaped Clive. "You two? Meeting Mr. Jones?
You might as well wish for the moon."

 ###Chapter 52 Is This How We RaisedYou
Raymond's face clouded over at Clive's harsh words."What's that supposed to mean?"


Raymond exchanged a glance with Margaret, an inexplicable sinking feeling passing between them.


Folding his arms across his chest, Clive let out a sharp, humorless laugh. "You two really believe Hannah married our CEO? That's almost funny. Let me break it down for you-your daughter has never been anything more than a mistress. Not a girlfriend,not a wife. For nearly five years, she's been living off Mr.Jones."


No effort was made to cushion his words. "If you want to know the truth, maybe you should ask yourselves how she ended up chasing money instead of building a real career. Instead of earning an honest living, she chose the easy road and became his kept woman."


Margaret erupted, her voice trembling with rage."That's not true! Don't you dare insult her!"


Shock hit Raymond so hard that he nearly lost his breath. Instinctively, Margaret reached over and rubbed his back until he calmed down.


Finally, struggling to steady his voice, Raymond said,"Our daughter worked hard and graduated from a top university. What gives you the right to slander her like this?"



Years spent as respected teachers had never prepared Raymond and Margaret for anything like this. Retirement had been peaceful back home until rumors about Vincent and his first love started to spread online. The stories unsettled them enough to travel all the way to Dorbarrow.


They'd hoped for answers, maybe even a long-overdue meeting with their son-in-law after their daughter's five-year marriage. Instead, they were hit with an avalanche of doubt. It was unthinkable. Could their daughter really have been lying to them all these years?


With a look of thinly veiled contempt, Clive answered, "All that education doesn't change reality.She's not working a real job, and Mr. Jones has dumped her. But she's still hanging around,desperate to get him back."


Pain flickered across Margaret's face. "He broke up with her?" The words felt heavy in her mouth.


A careless shrug was all Clive gave. "Yeah. Mr. Jones is back with his first love, and they're practically inseparable. They're traveling abroad right now. As for Hannah, she's no longer part of his life."


The revelation left Raymond and Margaret stunned,paralyzed by the realization that everything they'd believed might have been a lie.


Not another word was spared for the devastated couple as Clive walked away, heading back to his routine as if nothing significant had happened.
...


Caught in heavy traffic, Hannah finally arrived at the Jones Group headquarters, nerves already frayed.Entering the lobby, she immediately spotted her parents sitting alone, their faces clouded with sadness and confusion. No part of her expected Vincent to show up, not after everything that had happened.



Approaching quietly, Hannah noticed just how shaken her parents looked. Hands clasped together,she spoke softly. "Why didn't you let me know you were coming?"


Margaret seemed ready to answer, but Raymond raised a hand, signaling her to stay silent. A stern gaze fixed on Hannah, he spoke with no room for argument. "Bring us to your husband."


Tension crept into Hannah's posture. The last thing she wanted was for her parents to become entangled with Vincent. "He's swamped at work these days.Meeting now isn't possible."
Unmoved, Raymond's voice turned even more insistent. "Call him. I want to speak with him myself."


Cornered by her father's persistence, Hannah reached for her phone and dialed Vincent's number.


Once went to voicemail. No reply. A second call-still nothing. By the third ring, it was clear he wasn't going to answer.


Familiar disappointment flickered in Hannah's eyes."See? He's busy," she said, forcing her features to remain calm.


"At least let us visit his office," Raymond added.


Panic threatened to surface on Hannah's face.Almost nobody at the Jones Group knew she was Vincent's rightful wife. To them, she was just a mistress, never acknowledged in public. If her parents ever learned that, anger wouldn't be the worst of it. Their hearts would break right in two. She knew she couldn't handle the sight of that-not now,not ever.
"We should just head home for now," Hannah suggested quickly. "Maybe we can tour his office another day."


Reaching for her father's arm, she tried gently to guide him toward the exit.


But Raymond pulled away from her, a deep disappointment coloring his words. "You're still keeping things from us. Hannah, is this how we raised you?"
###Chapter 53 | Want To Hear It FromHim Myself
A chill swept through Hannah as her father's reaction landed, dread coiling tightly inside her. "Is something wrong?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.


Margaret started to reply, but Raymond silenced her with a stern hand. "Let me handle this."


Facing his daughter, his words shook with emotion,and he barely managed to keep in check. "Answer me, Hannah. Is Vincent Jones truly your husband-the CEO everyone talks about?"


Hannah immediately guessed what had happened.Someone must've told her parents something-and it was most likely that secretary Clive.


The lobby grew busy around them, yet more and more people slowed their steps, drawn by the tension building in the air.


Determined to avoid an ugly public confrontation,Hannah tried to steady herself. "We'll talk at home.Please, let's leave now, and I'll explain everything there."


But Raymond wouldn't budge. "We're not going anywhere. You answer me right now. Are you working a real job, or have you really been living off a man all this time?"



That word hit like a slap. Hannah instinctively shook her head. "No, that's not true."


"Then start explaining," he urged, his finger trembling as he pointed at her. "Tell me the truth.Is your marriage even real? Why does no one acknowledge you as Vincent Jones's wife? Why is everyone saying you're just his mistress?"


He fixed her with an unyielding stare, desperate for answers. But Hannah looked away, unable to speak.


The tension in his raised voice only escalated. "Don't just stand there. Say something! I want the truth!"


A circle of onlookers had formed, their whispers and camera phones quietly recording the unfolding family drama. Hannah refused to utter a word in front of strangers.


Raymond mistook her silence for shame. His expression collapsed into heartbreak. Their daughter... She had truly ended up living as another man's kept woman. Pain was clear in his eyes, and he backed away. "Get out of my sight. You're not the daughter | thought I raised. The Hannah I know wouldn't trade her dignity for a life like this."


His breathing turned ragged, each breath rougher than the last.



Hannah opened her mouth, trying to steer the conversation elsewhere-to stop this downward spiral-but the moment she lifted her head, she saw her father struggling for breath, his face drained of color. "Dad! Dad, what's happening?"


Margaret jumped in quickly, cradling her husband  and rubbing his back. "Hannah, his blood pressure's spiking. We need to get him to the hospital,now!"


A shaky "Alright" was all Hannah could manage.


The lobby's curious eyes, their murmurs, and the flashes from phones faded as Hannah hurried her parents outside, her gaze cold and distant.


None of the trio spoke during the ride. Silence pressed in on all sides.


Before long,Raymond was admitted to the hospital.


Tears streaked down Margaret's cheeks as she tried to find her voice. "Maybe we never should have come, Hannah. This only made things worse for you."


Sitting close, Hannah reached for a tissue and gently dabbed her mother's face, whispering, "Mom,please. Dad's going to pull through. You have to trust that."


Grief made Margaret's voice quiver as she looked up,her eyes red and swollen. "Hannah, have things been hard for you all these years?"
Fingers gripping her daughter's hand for support,Margaret pleaded, "Come back with us. Life might be quieter, but at least you'll have your dignity. I can't bear to see you living like this." Always, their daughter had stood tall and proud. The thought of her being anyone's mistress was almost too much for them to bear.


A dull ache filled Hannah's chest as she watched her mother struggle to hold herself together. Worry had driven her parents all this way, hoping for reassurance and a glimpse of happiness in her life.All they had wanted was to meet Vincent and see her contented finally. Instead, they'd been met with doubt and humiliation.



Happiness for their only child had always been their greatest wish. Facing a truth so painful seemed impossible.


Blinking back her own tears, Hannah squeezed Margaret's shoulder, trying to sound light even though her heart was heavy. "Mom, I'm not someone's plaything. Vincent and I are actually married. It's just that we kept the marriage under wraps. You know how these wealthy families are-it's all about appearances."


A hopeful look flickered in Margaret's eyes. "Is that true?"


Determined to prove herself, Hannah decided to call Vincent again. "You don't have to worry, Mom. Dad's here in the hospital, and I know Vincent will come as soon as he can."


In reality, Hannah had once planned to tell her parents she and Vincent were getting a divorce. But circumstances had changed, and the truth would only cause more pain now. Right now, she needed to put their minds at ease.


Once her father was stable and out of emergency care, a measure of relief settled over Hannah.


Taking her seat at his bedside, she leaned in and explained quietly, "Dad, I really am married to Vincent. We just never made it public, which is why there are so many rumors. But you have my word, it's real."



Suspicion lingered in Raymond's eyes as he turned toward his wife. "You believe her?"


Margaret nodded with quiet conviction."Ido."


Still, Raymond looked skeptical. "Don't try to lie to me just because I'm not well. I can handle the truth,no matter what it is."


Hannah shook her head. "I'm telling you the truth.Vincent and I are legally married." She paused, willing herself to stay strong. "If you want, I'll even bring the marriage license for you to see."


A skeptical look remained on Raymond's face. "If what you're saying is true, bring Vincent here. I want to hear it from him myself."

###Chapter 54 | Want To Head BackSooner
Raymond shifted upright in the hospital bed,determination flashing in his eyes. "No matter how busy Vincent claims to be, I am his father-in-law, and I deserve at least a visit."



A meaningful glance passed between Raymond and Margaret,silent understanding hanging in the air.


He added, "Besides, you two have been married for five years, and we've never even met your husband.That doesn't feel right."


Hannah met his gaze, sensing his resolve and knowing nothing she said could change his mind.


Trying to smooth things over, Margaret offered a gentle smile, "Don't worry. Our daughter said Vincent would come. Let's trust her."


Without hesitation, Hannah replied, "I'll call him right now."


Stepping into the hallway, Hannah kept her phone pressed to her ear, hoping Vincent would finally answer. But call after call went unanswered, each one feeding her mounting anxiety.


Frowning, Hannah reached out to Derek for answers."Any idea where Vincent is right now?"


"Mr. Jones left the country on a business trip. Has something happened?" Derek didn't need to ask-just by the sounds in the background, he could tell she was calling from a hospital.


Avoiding the details, she kept her voice steady. "Do you know when he'll return?"


"He didn't mention a specific date. Maybe try calling him directly?" Derek suggested, treading carefully.


With nothing left to say, Hannah murmured,"Thanks," and ended the call.


Resorting to Derek was a last resort. She hadn't wanted to bother him, but Vincent's silence left her no choice. She then sent Vincent a message. "When are you coming back?"


But after she hit send on the message, the urge to call vanished completely. Still, when she caught sight of her parents' hopeful faces through the glass of the hospital room window, something in her refused to give up.


Relentlessly, she kept dialing his number, feeling the old ache she thought she'd buried return with every unanswered ring. That familiar sting of waiting for Vincent, of being met with silence, dragged her back to the hardest ###Chapters of their marriage.


Painful as it was, Hannah pressed on, for her parents'sake.



Somewhere between desperation and resignation,the call finally connected.


Vincent's voice on the other end let Hannah release a shaky sigh of relief. "Vincent, when are you coming back?"
Silence lingered on the line, a drawn-out pause that made Hannah's nerves stretch thin. It sounded as though Vincent was checking his surroundings before finally responding, "Probably three days.What's the matter?"


Her lips parted and answered, "My parents-"


Suddenly, another voice floated through the phone,unmistakably Brinley's. "Vincent, give this a try."


Everything inside Hannah turned to ice. Numb realization settled over her. No business trip had taken him overseas-he was on vacation, basking in Brinley's affection.


A heavy, painful silence followed. Not even the static offered comfort.


Then, Vincent's voice came through again. "You were saying about your parents?"


An edge crept into Hannah's reply. "It's nothìng important. They just sent me some local specialties."


He offered only a vague sound of acknowledgment, his thoughts already drifting away. His voice was low."Anything else?"


She hesitated for a moment, still holding onto a shred of hope. "It's just... Would you mind talking to my parents-"


Before Hannah could finish, the call disconnected,cutting her off mid-sentence. Through the crackle of the dead line, Brinley's voice carried faintly, calling Vincent's name.



Familiar disappointment wrapped around Hannah's heart. She'd seen this pattern so many timnes, but the sting never faded. For a fleeting moment, when Vincent answered, she'd believed he might actually help her, play along for her parents' sake. Anything to keep them from worrying in their old age. Reality however, showed no mercy. Vincent was somewhere far away, wrapped up in a new romance, oblivious to the promises he'd made her long ago.


Standing in the hallway, Hannah watched her parents through the hospital door, self-blame weighing her down like a heavy blanket. Fully grown, and yet sheDetermined not to let them see her falter, she composed herself and strode back into the room,wearing a bright, practiced smile. "I told you-he's really busy. He's away on business right now."


The hope faded instantly from their faces, replaced by shadow and worry.


A deep sadness etched itself across Margaret's features.



Raymond kept his gaze locked on Hannah, silent at first. After a moment, he released a heavy sigh."I just hope you haven't lied to yourself so long that you actually believe it."


Margaret's voice trembled with sadness. "Tell me,Hannah, if this marriage is real, what kind of son-in-law avoids his in-laws for five whole years?"


No words came to Hannah. The truth was too bitter to share, and she knew that without meeting Vincent,her parents would never believe her. Explaining that her husband's heart belonged to someone else would only deepen their worry and heartbreak.


The sting of their disappointment made it hard for Hannah to even draw breath. "He'll visit once his work settles down," she replied, forcing a smile that felt brittle.







Thousands of miles away in Calveria, Brinley touched Vincent's arm gently. "Vincent, the people you're meeting have arrived."


Vincent had taken a red-eye flight on his private jet to Calveria after receiving an urgent acquisition proposal the night before.


Brinley had insisted on joining him, claiming a change of scenery would lift the weight from her mind.


Before agreeing, Vincent had checked with her doctors-travel, they assured him, could be good for her heart. Besides, it suited him to put some distance between himself and Hannah-she'd been acting up a lot lately.


What surprised him was how quickly her calls and texts started pouring in as soon as he left. A subtle smirk crossed his lips.


Brinley, noticing the faint curve of his lips, asked with curiosity, "What is it, Vincent? Did the deal meet your expectations?"


Vincent's response was smooth, but his satisfaction was clear. "Nothing." All those texts. All those calls.Hannah was clearly rattled. He knew it-she cared about him deeply.


Fastening his cufflinks, Vincent stepped into the meeting room with unshakeable confidence. Minutes later, he'd dissected the acquisition proposal,exposed glaring issues, and secured an extra three percent profit for the company with sharp, decisive tactics.



Plans shifted quickly after the meeting. Brinley,watching the pace pick up, wondered if Vincent was just eager to have more free time with her. She asked softly, "I thought we'd stay for three days?"


Sunlight poured in through the towering windows as Vincent considered her words. A faint, mysterious smile played on his lips. "I want to head back sooner," he answered.
###Chapter 55 Inviting Them To Lunch
Back at the hospital, Hannah decided to steer the conversation away from Vincent and began talking about her work instead.


News that Hannah actually held a job brought a flicker of relief to her parents. Curious and a bit anxious, they started peppering her with questions about her daily routine and responsibilities. Bit by bit,their faces softened-at least the rumors of unemployment weren't true.


Still, Margaret gently circled back to the issue that troubled her most. "Even so, Hannah,your father and I need to meet your husband at some point," she insisted. She couldn't rest easy until she'd seen her son-in-law in person, especially after everything people had said about their daughter.


Her voice low and uncertain, Hannah said,"Okay."

 
When Raymond's IV finished, he wasted no time insisting on being discharged. The heavy scent of antiseptic in the hospital made him restless.


Since there was no convincing him to change his mind, Hannah had no other option but to finish filling out the discharge forms. Rather than return to the Jones estate and risk an awkward encounter with Danica, she brought her parents back to her place at Sterling Heights.


A stack of delivery boxes greeted them outside Unit 2201.


Margaret eyed the packages and asked, "Has it been a while since you came home?"


"Yeah, I haven't been back much lately," Hannah replied, her words guarded.


Raymond took in the fresh look of the apartment, his skepticism clear. "Everything here looks untouched.Do you and Vincent actually stay here?"


Calmly, Hannah lied, "We moved back to the Jones estate recently. Vincent bought this apartment as an investment, but it's under my name."


Trying to reassure them, she added, "There's really no reason to doubt me. I'm married to Vincent.He's... He's been quite generous with me."


"We'll see for ourselves when he finally shows up."Raymond remained unswayed, his voice firm.


A gentle nudge from Margaret and a warning look urged him to stop, but he just shrugged. "I didn't say anything wrong."


Margaret could only roll her eyes in mild exasperation.


At that moment, Hannah's phone lit up. It was Sharon. A moment's hesitation passed before she answered."Hello? Sharon?"


Recognizing the name on the call, Margaret and Raymond exchanged a look.


"Hannah, it's getting late. Why aren't you back yet?"Sharon's voice filtered through the phone, concern clear as day.

Only then did Hannah glance at the clock. Ten o'clock had crept up on her. Normally, she would have called Sharon to explain if she planned to miss dinner. A quick apology slipped from her lips. "Sorry,Sharon. I forgot to let you know, I won't be home tonight. My parents are visiting, and I'd like to spend a few days showing them around Dorbarrow."


That news caught Sharon off guard. "Your parents are here? That's wonderful!" Her tone grew more serious. "In that case, bring them over tomorrow,Hannah. I'll arrange a proper dinner so we can welcome them."



A gentle refusal from Hannah followed. "Thank you,but it's alright. I'll handle things myself. My parents are only here for a short while before they head home."


Raymond,unable to sit by any longer, reached for the phone before Hannah could react. "Hello, is this Ms.Sharon Jones? I'm Hannah's father, Raymond Scott."


Sharon's reply was gracious. "Hello, Mr. Scott. I haven't been feeling well and haven't had the chance to visit. But now that you're in town, I'd love to host a meal for you and your wife. Would you be available tomorrow?"


A spark of hope brightened Raymond's face. "That sounds perfect! We've been wanting to meet our in-laws for a long time."


Hannah made a move to reclaim her phone, but Margaret quickly stepped in to hold her back.


Eager to cement the invitation, Raymond continued,"It would mean a lot for my wife and me to finally meet Vincent. Would tomorrow work for everyone?"


Warmth and a hint of curiosity colored Sharon's response. "We'd be delighted to have you. Although,isn't Vincent with you right now?"


Raymond answered honestly, "No, unfortunately not.Hannah mentioned he was busy with work, so we haven't seen him yet."


A brief pause stretched over the line before Sharon spoke, her voice now edged with purpose."Thank you for letting me know. Let's settle it-tomorrow at noon, come to the Jones family estate. We'll have lunch together."


"That's wonderful," Raymond said, his mood visibly lifted as he ended the call. A weight lifted from his shoulders, he finally felt reassured-at least for now,those ugly rumors about his daughter being a mistress had lost their hold.
###Chapter 56 Why Aren't You WithHannah
A furrow formed on Hannah's brow as she struggled to keep her frustration in check. "Dad, you agreed way too quickly. Why would you do that without asking me first?"


"What's the big deal about two families sitting down for a meal?" Raymond countered. "What's strange is your reaction. Why are you so against us having dinner with them? What, now that you've married into money, you're suddenly embarrassed by your parents?"


Margaret chimed in, "Hannah, you don't want us to meet the Jones family?"


A rush to defend herself left Hannah's words tumbling out. "No, that's not it at all! Of course, I want you to meet them."
Truthfully, the thought of her parents mingling with the Joneses filled Hannah with dread. She wished desperately that their lives could remain separate.


Raymond didn't miss a moment. "Good. I'm really looking forward to meeting your husband."


What he didn't say out loud was that he had his own plan-once he saw Vincent, he would find an excuse to visit the company. He wanted a word with that secretary who'd dared to badmouth his daughter. No one would ever get away with shaming his family,least of all his little girl.


That night, the apartment at Sterling Heights echoed with Hannah's restless movements as she tidied up,unable to shake her anxiety. Sleep came in fragments, leaving her even more unsettled.






Across the ocean in Calveria, Vincent finished closing a major deal when his phone buzzed insistently.Sharon's name flashed across the screen. He answered right away.
"Vincent, you ignore my calls now? Three times I've tried to reach you!" Irritation laced every word as Sharon spoke, her voice cutting sharper than before.


Vincent glanced at the call logs. Three missed calls from her. "Work kept me busy, Grandma. I didn't mean to miss them."



Sharon's tone didn't soften. "Busy with what,exactly? For all I know, you're just avoiding us." A chill crept into her voice. "Answer me this, why aren't you with Hannah? No matter what your schedule looks like, shouldn't you be by her side at a time like this?"


A heavy frown settled on Vincent's face. "Did she say something to you?"


"I wish she would," Sharon replied, a note of sadness underlying her words. "That girl suffers in silence.She'd never say a word, even if you've let her down.It's notin her nature to speak up."


Vincent's frustration grew. "What areyou getting at,Grandma?"

Her answer was immediate. "You'll be home for lunch tomorrow."


A flat refusal escaped him. "I can't make it. There's an important meeting I can't reschedule."


Sharon's warning cut through his protest. "If you're not at the family estate by noon, don't call me your grandmother ever again."


An exhale of exasperation slipped from Vincent. "I'm still in Calveria, finalizing the acquisition. There's no way I can return that fast."

An uncomfortable pause filled the call, neither side quick to speak.


Eventually, Vincent's voice came through, cautious."Is there something special about tomorrow that l should know?"


Sharon's tone turned icy, slicing through the distance between them. "You really have no idea? Hannah's parents are in town. As their in-laws, it's our responsibility to treat them with respect and host them properly."


The revelation left Vincent momentarily speechless,and suddenly, Hannah's words from earlier this morning made perfect sense. Brows knittíng together, he admitted, "Honestly, I wasn't aware. No one told me."



A weary sigh escaped Sharon. The weight of disappointment pressed into her next words."Hannah deserved so much more from the start.You two got married in secret without so much as a ceremony or celebration. Five years have passed,and her parents still remain strangers to us. This time, we need to make things right. You must be back by noon tomorrow. Do you understand?"


"I'll do what I can," Vincent replied, tension lining his voice.


In the corner, Brinley listened in silence, her own feelings roiling beneath a calm exterior. Why pretend for the sake of appearances, she wondered, when divorce was already looming on the horizon?
Observing Sharon's unwavering support for Hannah,Brinley realized just how fiercely protective Sharon was, clearly the greatest hurdle between her and any future with Vincent.



With a quiet resolve, Brinley tucked away that realization and then appeared at Vincent's side,offering him a plate of fruit and a sweet, practiced smile. Her hand paused when she overheard him on the phone, calmly rescheduling the next day's meeting to an online session.


Shock flashed in her eyes. Was he really flying home so suddenly? It had taken her a lot of effort to get Vincent to bring her on this trip abroad, and yet the entire time, he'd been buried in negotiations. No sightseeing, no real time together. Finally, just as she thought she'd have his full attention, everything was upended, once again, by Hannah.


Bitterness curled inside Brinley, mixed with a sense of insecurity she couldn't shake. Hannah was just a stand-in. So why was Vincent going to such lengths for her?
...


Back in Dorbarrow, Sharon rose before dawn,orchestrating the kitchen staff with the energy of a general preparing for a feast.


When Danica descended the stairs and took in the scene, a flurry of activity and gleaming silver platters, her curiosity sharpened into suspicion."Who's coming over today?" she asked.


"The lunch is to welcome Hannah's parents," a servant replied with honesty.


At once, Danica's expression clouded over.What was Hannah thinking, throwing a family gathering on the eve of her own divorce?


Without wasting another second, Danica marched back upstairs and dialed Hannah's number.


Over at Sterling Heights, Hannah was busy helping her father choose a jacket. Her phone's persistent ringing finally caught Margaret's attention, prompting her to answer.
###Chapter 57 What Kind Of Life HadShe Really Been living

Barely had Margaret answered the call before a harsh voice came barreling through the receiver.


"Just how thick-skinned are you, Hannah? Still pushing Sharon to host a lavish lunch for your parents? What's the deal-are they really that eager to set foot in a rich family's house like ours?Honestly, calling you shameless doesn't even scratch the surface. You're not just shameless. You're foolish, and worse, you know exactly how to twist things to get what you want."


The tirade hit Margaret like a slap, leaving her momentarily speechless. Was this woman actually insulting Hannah?


Heat rushed to Margaret's cheeks, but she fought to steady her voice. "Excuse me. Who do you think you are, speaking about my daughter that way?"
A beat of silence hung between them. Danica,caught off guard, realized she was speaking to Hannah's mother but didn't mince her words. "So what if I insulted her? What I said is true. Isn't it typical of a low-class family to raise such a grasping,shallow daughter?"


Pain and anger twisted in Margaret's chest. She dug her nails into her palm but kept her voice even. "You know nothing about my child. Hannah has more decency in her little finger than you could ever understand."


Something in the speaker's tone, arrogance mixed with cold contempt, told Margaret everything she needed to know. This must be Hannah's mother-in-law. Righteous fury rose in Margaret's voice. "If we're comparing mothers, I'd say you've failed more spectacularly. How else would you explain a son like Vincent, who can't even manage basic manners?"


"You!" Danica fumed, all bluster and outrage. The resemblance to Hannah's stubbornness was almost uncanny.

 Without waiting for another insult, Margaret ended the call and let the phone drop to her lap. She glanced toward the living room where Raymond and Hannah were still chatting about his outfit, blissfully unaware. Part of her wanted to suggest cancelling the visit. Wouldn't it be easier to skip the Jones family estate and simply enjoy Dorbarrow together,just the three of them?



But Danica's words lingered in Margaret's mind, sour and sharp. What sort of world had her daughter been living in all these years?


Each passing moment tightened the ache in Margaret's chest, yet her curiosity grew stronger. No word of the conversation left her lips, but the spark of anticipation was gone.


From across the room, Hannah noticed her mother's shift in mood and guessed she was still upset about the uncertainty of seeing Vincent. Slipping an arm around Margaret's shoulders, she spoke softly. "It'll be fine, Mom. Vincent will show up for lunch."

That was what Sharon had told her. With his grandmother's word as law, Hannah felt sure Vincent wouldn't dare refuse.



Hearing those words, Raymond's spirits lifted, and a broad, genuine smile creased his face.


Margaret, on the other hand, managed only a faint nod, her expression revealinglittle of what she truly felt.



They made their way to the Jones estate with Hannah at the wheel, a carefully wrapped gift nestled in her lap.


Arriving at the gates, they found Sharon already waiting for them, her presence dignified and welcoming, with several staff members at her side.


The scale and formality of the greeting left both Raymond and Margaret slightly awed and a bit unsure of themselves.



Reaching for Sharon's arm, Hannah offered a warm introduction. "These are my parents, Sharon."
"Hello, Mrs. Jones." Raymond and Margaret greeted her and then passed their gift to a waiting attendant.


Sharon welcomed them with a radiant smile. "I'm so glad you're here. For years, l've hoped for this moment. If my health were better, I'd have visited you myself to thank you for raising such a wonderful daughter. We're so fortunate to have her in our lives."


Raymond,caught off guard by such genuine praise,could only stutter, "Thank you. That's very kind of you."


Deep inside, relief washed over him. Any lingering doubts or nasty rumors of his daughter being a kept woman evaporated-his daughter was clearly respected and valued here.


Margaret, moved nearly to tears, felt the tension in her chest finally ease. With Sharon watching over Hannah, maybe things wouldn't be so hard for Hannah after all.


Pointing at a woman nearby, Sharon continued,"This is Vincent's mother,Danica."

An icy smile flickered across Danica's lips as she forced a greeting. "Hello." Her reluctance was obvious. She had come only at Sharon's insistence.


Recognition flashed in Margaret's eyes the instant she heard that voice. The memory of that earlier phone call-and the insults-came flooding back.


Maintaining her composure, Sharon's presence remained steady and authoritative. "Vincent should arrive soon," she announced, smiling at Hannah's parents. "Shall we start lunch while we wait?"


Raymond offered a polite response. "That sounds wonderful. Thank you."


Inside the dining room, a lavish spread awaited.Sharon herself guided Hannah's parents to their seats, ensuring they felt included.


Danica took the seat farthest from Raymond and Margaret, fanning her hand in front of her face."My God, is that musty thrift-store smell coming from them?"
The air thickened instantly. The conversation stopped. Raymond and Margaret stiffened,trying to hide their discomfort and wounded pride.


Before Hannah could uttera word in protest, Sharon placed a firm, reassuring hand on her arm.


With a cool, commanding gaze, Sharon looked straight at Danica. "If you're not in the mood to join us, you're welcome to excuse yourself."


With a dramatic sigh, Danica poured herself a generous glass of wine. "I suppose that was out of line. Let's call it water under the bridge. I'll drink to make up for it."


Sharon's stern features relaxed a shade, though her gaze never fully softened.


Feigning curiosity, Danica flashed a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "So, you're both retired from teaching,right?"


Margaret's response came quietly, eyes guarded.

Raymond, however, straightened with a hint of pride.
"That's right. Teaching was our passion for many years."


A glint of mischief danced in Danica's eyes as she pressed on. "Tell me, what sort of pension does that career earn you these days?"


"Put together, it's a bit over ten thousand," Raymond answered honestly. That amount had always been enough for them to live without worry-they'd never relied on Hannah to get by.


A sharp, mirthless laugh burst from Danica. "Ten thousand? My goodness, that wouldn't even buy a single handbag from my collection!"


She swept a hand toward the table, her tone turning careless. "Watch out for the silverware,would you?Each piece is worth more than a teacher's salary for a year. Break one, and you'd spend the rest of your life paying it off."


Embarrassment flickered across Raymond's and Margaret's faces as they exchanged an uneasy glance.
Hannah's hands curled into fists beneath the linen,her chest tightening at the cruelty of it all.


An icy edge sliced through Sharon's patience."Danica, that's enough. Go upstairs." The reprimand set off a sudden fit of coughing, her anger unmistakable.

###Chapter 58 Her Mother ConfrontedDanica
Private jet engines hummed beneath Vincent's feet as he prepared for takeoff, focused on making it home in time for the family lunch.


Brinley, however, wasn't in the best mood. Anxiously,she tapped her phone again and again, refreshing her email in anticipation. Only the night before, she'd pulled strings and spent a significant sum to contact a prestigious hospital. Finally, the awaited reply illuminated her screen, making her heart skip.


Feigning excitement, she leaned over and shook Vincent's shoulder. "Vincent! The doctor finally replied!"


He had barely slept over the past two days, having worked around the clock to close the acquisition deal. Being abruptly shaken awake, his eyes darkened with fatigue and annoyance. "What is it?"
Trying to sound as bright as possible, Brinley explained, "I've been reaching out to top heart specialists in Calveria. One of them just emailed me.They're willing to see me for a consultation."


Vincent's brow furrowed, still half-asleep. "Right now?"





"Yes, but I know you promised your grandmother lunch," she said, biting her lip. "Really, don't let me keep you. I can go alone if I have to. Family should come first."



Her words dripped with self-sacrifice, as though she was letting him off the hook.


For several moments, Vincent sat in silence,deliberating.Decision made, he spoke to the captain."Change our course. We're heading to the hospital."Turning to Brinley, his voice was gentle. "Your health is more important than anything else."


He figured a meal at home could always be postponed. This appointment, on the other hand,might be a rare opportunity. He couldn't afford to let  anything happen to her.


Satisfaction flashed in Brinley's eyes. She wasted no time sending a triumphant message to Hannah.






Back at the Jones estate, following Sharon's harsh rebuke, Danica grew quiet, seeking comfort in another glass of wine.


With gracious warmth, Sharon smoothed over the earlier unpleasantness, ensuring Raymond and Margaret felt welcome. The meal soon settled into a peaceful rhythm.


By the time dessert was served, one chair remained conspicuously empty. Raymond finally spoke up. "ls Vincent not joining us?"


Hannah's hands fidgeted in her lap. Uncertanty clouded her features.


Setting her silverware aside, Sharon stood and offered a reassuring smile. "Let me see what's keeping him."
Before stepping away, Sharon caught Hannah's eye."Hannah, just make sure your parents are comfortable and have everything they need. No need to treat us with such formality."


"Okay." Hannah nodded.


Just as Hannah turned to ask if her parents wanted anything else to eat, a sharp laugh cut through the air.



Danica's voice rang out, dripping with scorn. "Do you really believe you're worthy of meeting Vincent? Just look at yourself-this wvhole thing is laughable." She took another deep swig from her glass.


With a steely glare, Hannah signaled to the staff."She's clearly had too much. Please take her upstairs."


"Understood." Obediently, two maids moved forward to help, but Danica jerked free, bristling. "I'm not drunk!"


A glare from Danica pinned the staff in place. "Think twice before you listen to Hannah. If you want to keep your jobs, don't take orders from her."


The two maids didn't dare to move, tension crackling in the silence.


Raising her voice for everyone to hear,Danica stood tall. "Since we're all gathered here,let me finally say what's been on my mind." Every eye in the room was on her as she spat out, "Your daughter, Hannah,is nothing more than a cheap knockoff-gaudy, tacky,and embarrassing for anyone to be seen with."


Margaret's hands balled into tight fists at her sides,all the warmth she'd felt from chatting with Sharon earlier draining away in an instant.


Years of teaching had trained Raymond to hold his tongue, but humiliation burned on his face as he tossed back his wine, silent and furious.


Hannah hurried to her parents, her worry growing as she saw her father's composure slipping. "She's just drunk," she said softly. "Please don't mind her.Normally... She's not like this."
Attempting to diffuse the situation, Hannah tried to guide Danica away from the table, only to be pushed aside.


Danica's eyes narrowed in contempt. "You think I wanted my son to marry her? Please. Your daughter was the one clinging to hm like a desperate hooker!When she first married into our family, she atleast knew her place, quiet, obedient, never making trouble. But now? She's mouthy and impossible to control. Thank goodness the marriage stayed under wraps. If anyone found out the great Jones family was linked to someone like her, we'd be a laughingstock!"


Turning her contempt on Raymond and Margaret,Danica added, "And you two, really, you really think you're fit to be related to the Jones family? Don't make me laugh."


A sharp gesture from her summoned the housekeeper. "Aubrey, scrub everything down after this. I want no trace of their poverty clinging to my dining room. Even the air feels dirty."
The coldness in Hannah's face deepened, but before she could respond, a glass of wine sailed across the table, landing squarely on Danica and soaking her dress.


Gasps echoed. Margaret, normally so gentle, had hurled it without a moment's hesitation.


For a moment, even Hannah was speechless-she had never seen her mother so fierce.


Raymond stared at his wife, wide-eyed. Decades together, and he'd never seen her lose control like this.



Danica erupted, shouting, "How dare you! What gives you the right to throw wine at me?"


Margaret met Danica's glare head-on, her voice ringing with conviction. "You deserve that throw," she declared, fury sharp in her eyes. "Back home, I don't even let my daughter do chores, but here, you treat her as if she's beneath you. You've gone way too far."


Leaning closer, Margaret gave an exaggerated sniff, a look of disdain curling her lips. "Funny, no matter how much perfume you wear, it can't mask that foul stench every time you open your mouth."


Danica bristled, words tumbling in disbelief. "You-"


"Oh, save it," Margaret snapped. "You think we're beneath you? Well, guess what? We look down on you too. A so-called prestigious family that treats their daughter-in-law like a servant? I wouldn't be surprised if your family business hits a dead end soon."



A scream erupted as Danica lunged, wild and furious,grabbing for Margaret's hair. "How dare you! I'Il tear you apart!"


But Margaret side-stepped with surprising speed,not even ruffled. "Tear me apart? You'd have to catch me first. Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but this miserable house."



Crashing against the table, Danica yelped in pain,but Margaret didn't even look back. Both Hannah and Raymond stood in shock, unsure how to process the  scene they'd just witnessed.


A swirl of emotions knotted Hannah's chest as she realized her mother had stood up for her. Never in her life had she seen her mother's sudden fierceness, so unyielding in the face of cruelty.


Margaret grabbed Hannah's hand and turned to Raymond, all business. "Well? Are you coming, or do you want to stay and be humiliated a minute longer?"


Raymond, trying to stay rational, stopped her for a second. "Aren't we waiting for Vincent?"


A shake of Margaret's head made her answer clear."After all that? What's the point?"


"Right," Raymond muttered.


With barely another glance at the house, the three of them left together, heads high and backs unbowed.


By the time Sharon hurried back into the dinìng room, the guests were gone, and Danica lay slumped at the table, reeking of wine and defeat.
Afterward, Hannah placed a quick call to Sharon to explain the abrupt departure and then drove her parents straight to the train station.


No amount of gentle pleading from Hannah could change her parents' minds. Both Raymond and Margaret were set on leaving Dorbarrow behind.


Hannah's heart felt heavy with regret. She knew she hadn't protected her parents from disappointment.Her thoughts swirled with self-reproach and sadness, but then a familiar voice broke through the haze. "Mrs. Jones, I finally managed to catch up with you."

###Chapter 59 False Hope
Derek hurried over, out of breath, his suit rumpled from the rush.


Catching sight of Derek, a flash of surprise and tentative relief passed over Hannah's features.Maybe, just maybe, Vincent had arrived too. Her gaze darted past Derek, scanning for any sign of Vincent but finding none.


But a single familiar silhouette lingered in the distance. A hopeful thought flickered in her mind.Perhaps Vincent was waiting in the car, sending Derek ahead as a scout. That thought gave her some hope-maybe her parents would still get to see him after all. She seized the moment to introduce Derek."Dad, Mom, this is Derek Barrett, Vincent's assistant."


"Nice to meet you." Raymond extended his hand with a genuine smile. He shared Hannah's mindset. The presence of an assistant suggested Vincent couldn't be far behind. Maybe the crowded station had simply delayed his arrival.


Meanwhile, Margaret remained quiet, her mind still spinning from the earlier confrontation at the estate.


Derek finally caught his breath and said politely,"Mrs. Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Scott, could you come with me,please?"


No hesitation showed in Hannah's response. "Of course."



A plan took root in her mind. If Vincent managed to salvage today and smoothed things over with her parents, she'd let bygones be bygones and even try to avoid another fight with him for the rest of their days together,however few remained.


As they made their way across the lot, the familiar lines of the Bentley caught Hannah's eye. Excitement surged as she hurried ahead and pulled open the back door.


But the seat inside was empty. Her hopeful expression vanished. Confusion and disappointment twisted inside her.Where was Vincent now?



Derek's eyes flicked to Hannah, instantly picking up on her expectation that Vincent would be waiting in the car, ready to greet them. The disappointment etched on her face confirmed his suspicions.


Turning away from the empty seat, Hannah finally looked to Derek for answers. He offered a stiff,apologetic smile and then reached into the back for several gift bags. "Mr. and Mrs. Scott, Mr. Jones wanted you to have these," he said, holding them out politely.


Raymond didn't reach for the bags. His voice had gone cool. "Is Vincent coming? Where is he now?"


Carefully, Derek tried to explain, "Mr. Jones got pulled into a last-minute merger negotiation. He couldn't break away. As soon as he realized he wouldn't make it in time, he asked me to deliver these gifts in his place."
A silent exchange passed between Raymond and Margaret. Both their faces showed only quiet disappointment, hearts aching for their daughter.


Swiping at the sweat on his borow, Derek tried to defuse the tension, wishing this part of his job didn't feel so thankless.



Hannah forced herself to stay composed. "It's almost time, Mom, Dad. Let me walk you back to the train."Facing Derek, her tone was icy. "We don't need the gifts. My parents have enough to carry as it is."


Her eyes held not a shred of warmth.


Derek hesitated, trying again to offer the bags, but neither parent budged. Seeing no other option, he quietly returned everything to the trunk, not saying another word.



Hannah dismissed Derek with a nod, then slipped an arm around her parents and led them to the train platform herself.


Minutes before departure, Margaret pulled Hannah into a tight embrace. "Hannah, if you're ever unhappy,just come home. We'll take care of you."


Raymond didn't speak, but the firm pat on Hannah's shoulder said enough.


Hot tears threatened to spill as Hannah nodded,her heart aching. Her parents had made the long journey out of concern, only to leave with deep worry for her.Self-blame and sorrow pressed down on her as she watched the train roll away.


Once the platform was empty, she finally checked her phone. Right at the top sat a message from Brinley. "You can stop waiting. Vincent won't be joining your family for lunch."

###Chapter 60 Vincent And Brinley At ACouple's Restaurant

Hannah glanced at the message, and a dry laugh escaped her lips. So that was why Vincent didn't come back-because of Brinley, again. She should've known. He had already taken Brinley on an overseas trip without a second thought. Why would he care about her parents?



A sharp pain clutched her chest. It lingered, deep and dull, but she endured it numbly. She suddenly felt the urge to cry. But she held it in. After all, she'd made a silent vow-no more tears wasted on Vincent.


Without pausing by the parked cars, Hannah slid into the driver's seat and steered toward the Jones estate.


Halfway through the drive, Rena's name flashed across the dashboard screen. Instinctively, Hannah figured Rena was calling to check in about the latest  scandal online. The moment she answered, she tried to sound steady. "Don't worry, Rena. I'm fine."


Rena's voice tightened with concern. "Wait, you already know?"


A wrinkle formed between Hannah's brows. That edge in Rena's voice hinted at something else entirely. "What happened?" she asked, keeping her eyes on the road.


Rena wasted no time. "Work sent me to Calveria for a few days. As soon as I finished, I thought I'd treat myself.Guess who I ran into at a couple's restaurant?Brinley and Vincent. Together."


Even with all the bracing she'd done, Hannah's heart skipped a beat before the ache returned. Vincent wouldn't spare time for lunch with her parents, but he had no trouble whisking Brinley off for a cozy meal.How ridiculous.


Rena could barely contain her anger. "Vincent is unbelievable! He's still your husband, yet he's flaunting his affair in another country? What does he take you for? Leave it to me, Hannah. I'll make sure they regret it."


"Rena." Hannah's voice came out a few seconds later, quiet and steady. "Don't ruin their dinner."


"But why shouldn't I? Aren't you upset?" Rena asked,genuinely baffled.


Hannah replied, "I don't see any point in getting worked up." After all, she didn't want Vincent anymore. And she certainly didn't care anymore.


Despite her words, Rena remained unconvinced. "Are you honestly alright? Please, Hannah, just promise me you won't do anything rash because of that scumbag."


Their friendship had its roots in a university competition years ago. Back in those days, Hannah's drive and brilliance had set her apart. She'd built Nova Tech from scratch. That shared commitment to women's empowerment was what brought them together.
Yet, things had changed after Hannah became Vincent's wife, leaving her career behind to focus solely on home and marriage. Rumors had swirled in their circles, painting her as nothing more than Vincent's kept woman. The talk had been vicious,sharpened by envy and spite.


For a long time, Hannah had rarely left the house.Facing the world meant risking the sting of stares and snide remarks, and for a long time, that fear had kept her indoors.


Transformation did not come overnight. In time,though, Hannah gradually discovered her own strength and refused to let people push her around.These days, few dared to test her patience.


No one understood the cost of that battle more than Rena. Empathy made Rena's heart ache for her friend.


A gentle tone slipped into Hannah's words. "promise I'm alright, Rena. There's just one thing |need. Would you take a few photos of them for me?It's important."
Before long, several pictures appeared in Hannah's inbox, showing Brinley and Vincent seated together,facing each other across the table.



Composure never left Hannah. She simply tucked the images away, saying nothing. Her parents had been subjected to an agonizing dinner, all thanks to Vincent, while he was out enjoying dinner with his mistress.



Disgust flickered across Hannah's face, silent but clear.





Rena spoke again. "No way. I won't let him have a pleasant meal."


Rena gave no warning or offered no details. She stayed on the call, and suddenly, the background filled with the lively hum of the restaurant and the crisp echo of footsteps, signaling her approach to Vincent's table.



"Mr. Jones, seems like you're having quite the evening," Rena remarked, her voice light. Vincent's only response was a tight-lipped frown.


A look of confusion swept over Brinley. "And who exactly are you?" she asked.


Rena tossed out a sly grin, her words sharp with sarcasm. "Let's just say crossing me would be your worst idea."



The next second, Hannah heard the sound of a table being flipped over through the phone.


Theatrics poured from Rena next, her voice booming,soaked in exaggerated sobs as she pointed at Vincent. "How can you be out romancing your mistress when my best friend is alone at the hospital,about to have a baby? You absolute scumbag!"


Every ounce of calm in Vincent evaporated on the spot. Ice flickered in his eyes, but the room around him erupted with gossip and curious stares.


A wicked smile curled on Rena's lips as she triedto slip away, only to have her exit blocked by a waiter.She jabbed a finger in Vincent's direction. "See him over there? He'll handle the bill."


As soon as Rena escaped the restaurant, her laughter spilled back through the phone. "Hannah,you should've been there. Vincent looked like he'd swallowed a thundercloud!"



Gratitude shone in Hannah's quiet laugh. "Thanks,Rena." The smile lingered, gentle and real.


They lingered on the call a bit longer, trading a few more words before saying goodbye.


Once alone, Hannah's warmth faded, replaced by resolve as she dialed her attorney. "Have you got everything lined up?" No time remained for excuses -Danica's constant delays had already tested her limits. The property transfer was already set in motion.



Assurance came quickly. "All the paperwork's ready.Just need signatures to finalize everything."


Without hesitation, she said, "I'll come get you now."


Wasting no time, Hannah swung by to pick up her attorney before making a beeline for the Jones estate. The sting of Danica's cruel words to her parents still echoed in her mind. There was no way she would simply let that go.


Once Hannah confirmed that Sharon was resting peacefully, she made straight for Danica's room without a single pause.


Stretched across the bed in a drunken mess, Danica looked oblivious to the world.


Hannah's next move took her to the kitchen, where she filled a hefty jar with cold water and brought it right back. She didn't hesitate as she splashed the water on Danica.


The shock of cold water sent Danica surging upright,choking out a gasp, her hair and clothes drenched.Her eyes landed immediately on Hannah, who stood over her without a flicker of regret.


Fury twisted Danica's face as she dragged a sleeve across her dripping cheeks. "Hannah, what's gotten into you?" she shouted, her voice ragged. An arm came up, ready to strike.


Quick as lightning, Hannah seized Danica's wrist,cutting off the slap before it started. With a sudden movement, she brought the glass jar crashíng down on the floor.


The harsh sound filled the room, making Danica shrink back.


A cold, steady glare met Danica's eyes. "You're always whining about the stench of poverty," Hannah replied. "I figured I'd help you rinse it off."
###Chapter 61 Forced Her To Sign

Hannah released her grip, and Danica stumbled back onto the bed.


With a sneer, Danica tossed her damp hair over her shoulder. "So this is what this is about? Standing up for your parents, I see." She rolled her eyes. "Tell me,did I say anything that wasn't true? Your family's always had nothing. If it weren't for the Jones family,you'd just keep sinking lower."


A steely coldness settled in Hannah's eyes."Appreciate the reminder. With the rest of your properties coming our way, it won't be long before the Scott family is swimming in wealth." After that,she settled herself in a chair and reached out her hand. "Go on, hand over the remaining seven properties."



Danica barely reacted. Instead, she raised her voice so everyone could hear. "What's your hurry? Like I
said before, handing over property doesn't happen in a snap. It's a process, you know."


She couldn't help but add in a mocking tone, "And let's be real, with your family of bookworms, can any of you handle that much money? How about this-we compromise. Since you and Vincent are parting ways, let's keep things friendly. I'll wire you ten million. Think of it as a parting gift from me. Not too shabby, right?" She flashed a broad, fake smile,acting as if she were being generous.


A cold laugh escaped Hannah. Danica honestly believed ten million would be enough to settle this?All those properties together would easily top a billion. Clearly, Danica was only dragging things out-she couldn't bear to hand over the assets she'd invested her year-long savings in.


"Absolutely not," Hannah said, her voice firm. "I want every single property you promised. Nothing less."


Danica's features tightened, and her words turned sharp. "Then there's nothing else to discuss. I've already told you, the transfer takes time. If you want Refusing to let her off the hook, Hannah spelled out the real problem. "You're not dragging this out because of any paperwork. You just can't stand to let go of the properties. You call yourself part of a rich family? You're stingy, and your promises mean nothing."


"You-" Danica stammered, at a loss for any real comeback. Determined not to back down, she steadied herself. "Say whatever you like. I've already explained that the transfer will take time. If you refuse to wait, that's not my fault."


Hannah narrowed her eyes. "Well, if that's how it is..."She glanced toward the doorway and said,"You can come in now."



An attorney, smartly dressed and holding a thick stack of files, entered the room.


A flicker of alarm crossed Danica's features."What are you playing at?"
Hannah responded without a hint of hesitation, "I asked my attorney to come here for a reason. Since you're too busy to process the transfers, I've handled everything for you."


Taking the stack of files, Hannah gave them a small wave in Danica's direction. "There are seven contracts right here, not a single one missing. All you have to do is sign. That way, we stop wasting each other's time."


Danica erupted with outrage. "This is blackmail!"


A humorless chuckle escaped Hannah. "You're something else. You broke your promise and then accuse me of blackmail? Who was it that said-loud and clear-that as long as | divorced Vincent, you'd transfer ten properties into my name? I've already signed the divorce agreement. Now you want to wriggle out of it?"


Forcing herself to appear calm, Danica clung to the hope that Hannah would not dare to push too hard. "I told you l'd give you the properties, and I will," she replied slowly. "Just leave the paperwork here.After Sharon's birthday is over, I'll take care of the signatures. Is that fair?"


Hannah smirked. "That almost sounds reasonable."


Relief crept onto Danica's face. She thought she had managed to buy herself a little more time. Every minute she kept those properties in her name felt like a small victory.


She opened her mouth to say something, but Hannah's tone turned cold. "But I'm done waiting. If you're so unwilling to hand over the properties, just sell them off and give me the cash instead."


A burst of anger shot through Danica. "Have you lost your mind, Hannah? How am I supposed to come up with more than a billion in cash?" All of her wealth was tied up in property.


With her arms crossed, Hannah kept her tone sharp as ice. "It looks like you have no choice but to sign right now."

 
Panic flickered across Danica's face. "I already told you, after Sharon's birthday, I'll sign everything.That's my word."


A steady resolve colored Hannah's answer. "And I already made it clear-I won't be waiting any longer."Her words came out quietly, but there was no room for argument. "Did you think I couldn't tell you were just playing for time?"


A cold scoff escaped Hannah's lips. "I only went along with your little game. You actually thought I believed it? And don't even try to accuse me of blackmail. Every one of these contracts says the transfer is a voluntary gift."


She nodded, and the lawyer, who had stayed quietly nearby, stepped up to arrange the contracts on the table.


Danica recoiled, taking a shaky step back. "Don't you dare force me to sign!"


Hannah's expression didn't budge. "I'm simply collecting what you promised me. What's so wrong with that?"
Defiance crept into Danica's voice. "I refuse to sign!"


At that, Hannah calmly drew two more documents from her bag and set them beside the contracts."These are my divorce agreements with Vincent. If you don't sign, I'll just tear these up instead."

###Chapter 62 Go Win Your Wife Back
Holding back her frustration, Danica kept her voice steady. "Ripping those divorce agreements up won't get you anywhere. Vincent never cared about you.Do you seriously want to stay married to him?"


A cold confidence colored Hannah's words. "That's right. Love doesn't mean much to me anyway. As long as the name Mrs. Jones holds some weight,that's all I'm after." She paused and then continued in a lighter tone, "And since I keep onto that title,there's no way I'm hiding in some secret marriage.The second these divorce agreements are ripped apart, I'll announce to everyone that I'm Vincent's rightful wife."



Disdain twisted Danica's lips. "Who on earth would buy that story? People will just see you as Vincent's mistress."


"Good point," Hannah mused. "Looks like I'll have to
ask Sharon to back me up."


That shut Danica up for a moment.


As Hannah lifted the divorce agreements, ready to tear them in half, panic surged in Danica's voice."Wait-hold on!"



Danica didn't want Hannah to cling to the position as Vincent's wife. Hannah's background disgraced the entire Jones family. If their secret marriage ever got out, the Jones family's reputation would be destroyed.


Even Danica had to admit-Hannah was right on one thing. Keeping the Mrs. Jones title was worth more than any number of properties. It wasn't exactly a bad deal, trading those properties for Vincent's freedom.


Still, parting with those ten properties was painful.Every single one had been carefully selected, from the neighborhood to the floor and the direction of the windows. Danica had poured so much energy into curating them. The thought of giving them all away in one go made her stomach twist. Yet, no matter how much it stung, Hannah had to divorce Vincent. That was the bigger issue. Those properties? She told herself she'd find a way to reclaim them one day.


Her mind made up, Danica gave in. "Fine. I'll sign."


With a tiny nod from Hannah, the attorney stepped forward and guided Danica through every contract.


Soon, the paperwork was finished. Hannah folded the divorce agreements neatly and slipped the signed property transfer contracts away.


A bitter edge sharpened Danica's final words. "Don't you forget what you promised me."


Hannah replied, "You don't need to worry. I'm nothing like you. When I make a promise, I keep it."The decision to divorce Vincent was already set in stone. If Danica hadn't gone after her parents so harshly, things never would have come to this.


Left with nothing else to discuss, Hannah gathered her things and went straight to work at Nova Tech. By the time her shift ended, she chose not to return to the Jones family home. Her car took her instead to Lakeshore Villa, where she threw out the things she didn't want, packed up what mattered, texted Sharon about not returning, and then set off for Sterling Heights. There was no sense pretending to be the loving wife when Vincent was overseas, busy with another woman.







Dorbarrow's city lights greeted Vincent and Brinley as their plane landed at eight in the evening.


Doctors in Calveria had assured them that Brinley's health had improved. She only needed to avoid strong emotions and take her pills on time to prevent her heart condition from returning.


Brinley thought about hosting a celebration, but before she could make plans, Vincent's phone rang.Sharon's voice left no room for argument-she ordered him to come home right away.


Inside the Jones estate, Sharon sat on the living room sofa, cane in hand and a look that would brook no nonsense.



Vincent's eyes searched the space, but Hannah was nowhere to be found. A deep crease formed on his brow. It puzzled him-where else could Hannah be at this hour?



"So you do remember where home is?" Sharon's cane hit the floor with a loud thump. "Hannah's parents traveled all this way just to see you.l reminded you over and over again. And what did you do? You ignored them. Now look-Hannah was so upset that she didn't even come home tonight."


Vincent froze.



A furious glare flashed in Sharon's eyes. Her grip tightened around her cane, and she lifted it, ready to strike Vincent.



Brinley moved quickly, jumping in front of Vincent."Sharon, don't be angry with Vincent-he only missed dinner because of me..."
Vincent's hand came up, cutting her off before she could say another word. Tall and steady, he faced Sharon without so much as a flinch. His face stayed calm, but his tone softened just enough. "You're right. I didn't handle this well. I'll speak with Hannah and explain everything."


He didn't want Sharon to get stressed about Brinley's heart condition.


Hearing the apology, Sharon's glare softened just a bit. "Then go make things right with your wife tomorrow."


Vincent pressed his lips into a tight line and kept silent. Thinking about Hannah only gave him a headache. She seemed to have a shorter fuse than ever these days.
###Chapter 63 Unexpected Encounter
A short while after the tension in the living room,Brinley headed straight for Danica's room.


Lying on the bed, Danica still simmered with anger over losing her properties. She stared at the ceiling,appetite gone and food untouched. Spotting Brinley at the door, a faint spark of hope stirred inside her.The complaints poured out. "Hannah walked away with all ten properties. All of them! Everything I've invested is gone just like that."


A shadow crossed Brinley's face. "She really is insatiable. But you can count on me. I'll make sure you get every single one back."


Brinley was pissed off. Hannah was getting divorced.She was about to be officially out of the Jones family.What right did she have to claim so much of their assets? A substitute like her? She didn't deserve that much.

"Are you serious?" Danica asked, hope flickering in her voice. "So what are you going to do?"


Leaning in close, Brinley whispered her plan.






Over at Sterling Heights, Hannah didn't spare a thought for the Jones estate. All of her attention was on the funds she had finally secured.


Her company with Felix was in its make-or-break stage, and the expenses were pilingup quickly.Sooner or later, she'd build a partnership with Miles,which would only add to the financial strain.


Nothing had been left to chance. Hannah mapped out a detailed financial strategy and handed it off to her team for implementation.


Vincent's "compensation," the ten million he wired her days before, remained untouched in her account.Kicking back on the couch, Hannah actually felt a rare calm and even looked forward to the future.


There was a time when just the idea of leaving
Vincent would have left her sobbing. Now, she stood on the edge of a new life: her marriage almost over,a place of her own, and a career that mattered. What could possibly/ top this feeling? The countdown was on. Nine days left, and everything with Vincent would finally be over.


Drowsiness was just starting to settle in when a faint meow came from the doorway.


Pulling the door open, Hannah found a cat waiting outside, its coat smooth and well-groomed,clearly someone's beloved pet.


She paused for a second, then scooped the cat into her arms and carried it inside. Quickly, she sent a message to the building's resident group chat,saying, "Did anyone lose a cat?" She included a photo of the cat with her message.


Gentle and affectionate, the animal pressed its head into her palm as if it had always belonged there.


Time slipped by as Hannah waited for someone to reply, and before she realized it, she drifted off to sleep with the cat curled up warmly in her arms.


Her nap didn't last long. A loud knock jolted her awake. Still half-asleep, she went to the door and pulled it open. She froze. Beside the building manager stood a man she recognized immediately.It was Miles Whitaker. His expression was unreadable as he stared right at her.


Surprise flickered across Hannah's face. "Mr.Whitaker? Why are you here?"


A sharp squint from Miles followed. She seemed oddly familiar, yet he couldn't quite remember where he'd seen her. That casual way she greeted him made his stomach knot. Predictable, he thought.Women always acted like this around him.


Earlier that evening, Miles had seen the group chat message and soon realized his apartment door had been left open, letting the cat slip out. He had answered in the group char straight away.


With no one replying, he'd checked the building's security cameras-sure enough, the woman from downstairs had picked up his cat. He had come to knock once, but no one answered. So he'd returned with the building manager.


Now, looking at her eager smile, a flicker of contempt crossed his face. How could she even know where he lived? The whole situation was absurd. She must be desperate to get his attention.


"Cat," Miles said, his tone short and clipped.


Understanding dawned for Hannah. "Oh-it's yours?Give me a second. I'll go bring it right out."


Just as she turned to go back inside, Hannah paused for a moment. Encounters with someone like Miles didn't come around often, and she didn't want to let the opportunity slip by. With a hesitant smile, she asked, "Mr. Whitaker, would you have any interest in talking about a business opportunity?"


A deeper scowl crossed Miles's face. "Not interested," he replied flatly.


That cold response left Hannah feeling a bit awkward. She stepped inside, gently scooped up the cat, and brought it over to the door. As she handed the animal over, Miles suddenly started sneezing,one after another.


Curiosity got the better of her. "Wait... Are you allergic to cats?"


His answer came quick and sharp. "That's not your concern," he snapped,reaching for the cat.


At the last second, Hannah drew back. "If you're allergic, Mr. Whitaker, maybe having a cat isn't the best idea," she suggested, keeping her voice even.


A sharp look cut across Miles's face. "Now you're giving me advice?" His brows knit together,annoyance clear.


The little kitten voiced a meow.


Holding in a sigh, Hannah kept her composure. "It's not my intention to lecture you. I just wanted to say that people with cat allergies sometimes develop asthma if they're around cats all the time. That's all- I thought it was worth mentioning, both for your health and the cat's well-being."


Without another word, Miles took the kitten and turned away. He sneezed once more and muttered to the cat, "Spend a little time with a stranger and you already forget who feeds you, huh?"


Watching him walk off, Hannah murmured, "So much for trying to be helpful..."


Even with such a brief exchange, she could tell Miles wasn't the easiest person to approach. It made her wonder if working with him would ever be possible.


Her phone buzzed just then. Vincent's name flashed on the screen. She pressed decline without a second thought.

###Chapter 64 Someone Was Out ThereUsing Her Old Identity

Vincent tried calling again, but Hannah didn't even flinch-she blocked his number right away.


A few moments later, just as Hannah was about to wash her face, her phone rang once more. This time,Rena's name lit up the screen. Hannah answered without a second thought. "Rena, are you back in the country?"


A playful and bright voice answered, "Yep!"


Then,Rena added, "Oh, and by the way, do you know Victoria Hale?"


Hannah stopped in her tracks the moment she heard the name. "What's got you bringing up Victoria all of a sudden?" she asked.


Victoria Hale had been Hannah's own alias during her college days, long before Vincent was part of her That part of her life had been her proudest. As Victoria, she'd built and launched a pioneering website to help keep women safe. But the attention it attracted had soon turned sour. Online trolls and anonymous threats had spilled over into her real life,eventually forcing her to give up the alias. Still, she had never given up on the concept of women's safety design. Afterward, she'd partnered with Felix and founded Nova Tech.


The day Hannah re-entered the tech world, Felix had encouraged her to go public as Victoria. But she'd turned down the idea. The past belonged behind her.She didn't want to cash in on an old name. What mattered now was building something real-something current.


Still buzzing, Rena continued, "There's a big business gala tomorrow at Cloudspire Center. My dad told me Victoria's on the guest list. Every major player from every industry is going to be there."


A dark cloud settled over Hannah's face. She had never received an invitation.


"Hello? Hannah? Are you still there?" Rena called out a few times before Hannah came back to the moment.


Hannah asked hesitantly, "Hey, Rena... Is an invitation needed for that event?"


Excitement filled Rena's voice. "Absolutely. I had a feeling you'd want to go, so I have already asked my dad for extra invitations."


She added enthusiastically, "With all those business heavyweights showing up, it's a perfect chance for you to get your face out there."


"Thanks, Rena. You're the best," Hannah replied, her smile genuine. Eight years had brought plenty of regret-marrying Vincent among them-but making friends with Rena had never been one of those mistakes.



After hanging up, Hannah searched online for information about the event. She learned that the  gala took place every two years, always centered on some headline-grabbing theme. For this year, all eyes were on the elusive and much-talked-about Victoria Hale.


A chill swept over Hannah's face. Someone was out there using her old identity.


The following morning, Hannah brushed on a bit of makeup and slipped into her go-to business suit before heading out the door.


Rena swung by Sterling Heights to pick Hannah up and instantly frowned at the sight of her outfit."Hannah, come on. That look is way too plain for tonight."


Settling into the back seat, Hannah finally noticed Rena's formal gown. Surprise flickered across her face. "Hold on... Isn't this supposed to be a business event?"



A small sigh escaped Rena. "It is, kind of. But it's also a fancy dinner," she explained, a note of frustration in her voice. "You mean you really didn't know?"
Of course, Hannah didn't. Vincent had never brought her along to one of these galas. She was completely out of the loop.


"I honestly had no idea," Hannah admitted. First time or not, she realized she needed to look the part. A glance at her watch told her there was still plenty of time before the event. An idea sparked right away."There's a boutique near Cloudspire Center. Want to help me pick out something more appropriate?"


A bright smile spread across Rena's face. "I'd love to!" She couldn't resist giving Hannah·a playful tap on the nose. "You know how much I enjoy being your stylist."


Inside the boutique, the racks held plenty of nice dresses, but none of the sales assistants even bothered to greet them.


Hannah brushed off the indifference. She checked the time again, determined to choose something quickly and make it to the event on time. A handful of dresses caught her eye, and she started toward the fitting rooms.
But Rena stopped her in her tracks. "The really high-end pieces are never left out front."


She had to call out a few times before a sales assistant finally appeared, looking anything but enthusiastic to help. "Welcome. But just so you're aware, we don't permit anyone to try on dresses if they're wearing makeup."


Rena pulled out her sleek VIP card, black and gold,and lifted her chin with confidence. "Show us your priciest gowns."


Instantly, the sales assistant's demeanor shifted.Respect colored her words now. "Absolutely.Which one of you will be doing the fittings?"


A step forward put Hannah in front. "I will," she replied. "I'm searching for something with an elegant touch."


A gesture led them forward. "This way, ladies.You'll be able to browse our exclusive collection," the sales assistant assured, leading them toward the VIP lounge.
 A quiet laugh slipped out as Rena glanced around."Let's hope the dresses aren't as tacky as the ones out front."



"Not at all," the sales assistant responded eagerly, a sweet smile fixed on her face. "These pieces are the best we have. You'll be impressed."


Without hesitation, they followed the sales assistant into the luxurious VIP lounge.


Inside, the selection spoke for itself. Rena's gaze landed on one dress in particular-a mint green number that hugged the waist just right. Simple but refined, it was the sort of dress that showed off a lovely figure.


"Try this one, Hannah," Rena remarked, her eyes bright with excitement.


Hannah gave a small, trusting smile. She never doubted Rena's taste. "Okay, I'lI give it a go."


The sales assistant quickly took the dress off the rack and handed it to Hannah.
 Hannah was only a step from the fitting room when another customer came into view. A glance upward stopped her in place.


Brinley walked out, a cluster of sales assistants following behind. She wore an extravagant white dress, and the headpiece she'd chosen was so elaborate that it almost passed for a wedding veil.

###Chapter 65 Accompanying TheMistress To Try On WeddingDresses

A flicker of surprise crossed Brinley's face when she spotted Hannah-what reason did Hannah have to be here?


But curiosity quickly shifted. Brinley's gaze slid tothe woman beside Hannah, and it took only a heartbeat to recognize her as the same person who had disrupted that romantic dinner back in Calveria.


Brinley quickly pieced it together. Since Hannah knew that woman, she must be behind the disruption at the restaurant. The whole scene had probably been orchestrated by her.


That realization made Brinley's blood boil, and she shot Hannah and her friend a look that could freeze the air.

 Rena was never one to stay silent. Her eyes narrowed at the sight of Brinley's gown, and her voice cut through the room. "They're still legally married, and you're already trying on a wedding gown? You really don't waste any time, do you? Where's Vincent hiding-trying not to get caught?"


All at once, the sales assistants stiffened, unsure if they should jump to serve their VIP client or just watch the fireworks. The way things looked, they might be witnessing a scandal unfold right before their eyes.


Not a word left Hannah's lips as she met Brinley's glare with a cold stare. She doubted Vincent was anywhere nearby-he never had the patience to sit around while someone tried on outfits.


Brinley's eyes turned stormy. "You should watch what you say."


Rena retorted sharply, "Oh, drop the act. Once a mistress, always a mistress. Even if Hannah signs the divorce papers, that won't change who you are. l'd honestly love to see what Vincent has to say about that."


With that, Rena strode over to a closed fitting room,not bothering to hide her contempt.


Brinley lifted the hem of her dress, trying to block her. "Don't cause a scene!"


That sudden movement triggered the sales assistants, who all rushed forward to stop any potential chaos.


A glance at her phone reminded Hannah she had better things to do. She had no interest in arguing with Brinley and certainly didn't want to deal with Vincent. "Just leave it, Rena. She isn't worth the trouble. We should just-"



Before Hannah could finish, Rena swung open one of the doors, and there was Vincent. Inside, he lounged as if he owned the place, speaking smoothly while leading what was obviously a meeting with people from different countries.


When someone barged in, he didn't even flinch-justlifted his eyes, calm and detached.


A mocking laugh slipped out of Rena. "Bravo, Mr.Jones. You've really perfected the cheating husband routine-even hiding out in a fitting room."


Brinley darted over and tried to drag Rena back."You're disrupting his meeting. Leave now."


Anger flared in Rena's eyes. "Who in their right mind holds a meeting here? Hiding in a fitting room while your mistress gets fitted for a wedding dress? Real classy,Vincent."


The sales staff hovered nearby, torn between doing their jobs and watching the spectacle unfold.


Humiliated and angry, Brinley raised her hand, ready to slap Rena.


That slap never happened-Hannah stepped forward,placing herself in front of Rena and catching Brinley's wrist mid-swing. Her words were as cold as steel."You think you can just hit people? I guess the word 'mistress' stings a bit."
"Let go!" Brinley exclaimed, her cheeks flushed with rage.


Hannah squeezed a little tighter before abruptly letting go, which sent Brinley stumbling backward.


Brinley didn't hit the ground, though-Vincent was there in a heartbeat, steadying her before she could fall.


Looking every inch the polished CEO in his custom suit, Vincent and Brinley, in her sweeping white gown, almost looked picture-perfect. To anyone watching,they seemed made for each other.


Vincent's eyes were filled with icy annoyance when he met Hannah's gaze.


All Hannah could do was sneer. A romantic getaway abroad just days ago, and now he was back,wasting no time playing dress-up with his mistress. In five years of their marriage, she had never experienced even a fraction of this.



A bitter smile crossed Hannah's lips as she met his  eyes head-on. "Well, Mr. Jones, you seem to have plenty of time for wedding dress shopping with your mistress. Did you forget about one small thing-our divorce?"
###Chapter 66 Perhaps You Should Get Moving On Our Divorce
Hannah spoke sharply, and Vincent's expression darkened with a hard frown. After making sure Brinley was steady on her feet, he turned to face Hannah and asked in a voice stripped of warmth,"How many times do I have to say it? I told you to quit talking about divorce. Haven't you thrown enough tantrums?"


Initially, Vincent had thought it was best to just give Hannah the silent treatment for a while-they'd been arguing too often lately, always over Brinley. But he hadn't expected Hannah to chase him down here and even make a scene.



A quiet satisfaction flickered across Brinley's face.She knew Vincent would take her side, no matter what.


Rena couldn't take it anymore and marched forward,
pointing right at Vincent. "You call this throwing a tantrum? Maybe take a look in the mirror. You and your lover started all this, but suddenly it's out of bounds to point that out?"


Not even bothering to acknowledge Rena, Vincent replied, "This doesn't concern you. Stay out of it.You're just an outsider."


That was enough to silence Rena, at least for a moment.


Hannah stepped protectively in front of her friend and let out a low, bitter laugh. "Then go ahead and talk to me. I'm not an outsider,aml?"



Whatever Hannah once felt for Vincent had finally faded away. Not a single drop of hope remained in her for him now. She gazed up at Vincent, a distant smile formed on her lips. "Since you've already brought her here to try on wedding dresses, perhaps you should get moving on our divorce."


Vincent's face grew stormy as he caught Hannah's wrist. "I told you, don't bring up divorce again."
Brinley glanced sideways at Vincent, momentarily surprised. So he was the one who didn't want the divorce? No, that couldn't be right. The way he cared for her didn't feel fake. Maybe he was just embarrassed by the confrontation.


Hannah let out a derisive smirk. Vincent had always been like this, claiming one thing while his actions suggested otherwise. The very man who resisted divorce was now parading another woman around,helping her choose wedding dresses. The irony was almost laughable.


Wrenching her wrist free, Hannah fixed him with a cold stare.



With just that look, Vincent felt the distance between them widen even further. He had been noticing her grow more indifferent toward him lately. He'd thought giving her the cold shoulder for a couple of days would make her panic and soften her approach toward her, maybe even going back to their past dynamics. However, after three long days apart, he found she seemed completely unfazed. Nothing about her reaction matched what he had imagined.


A flash of annoyance crossed Vincent's face as he tugged at his tie, searching for relief.


Not wanting to drag things out, Hannah lost all desire to try on that soft green dress anymore. She handed the gown to an assistant and headed straight to the register to pay.


From the register all the way to the exit, she never once turned to glance at Vincent.



Vincent's mood darkened.



Brinley reached out and softly took his hand. "Please don't be upset, Vincent. Hannah just gets the wrong idea.I'll try to explain things to her."


Finally, Vincent's gaze landed on Brinley.


Brinley caught his gaze and spun with a grin. "Well?What do you think, Vincent?"


A sharp edge crept into his voice as he replied, "Take it off."
That response left Brinley frozen, confusion written across her face. "What... What did you just say?"


Cold and unwavering, Vincent answered, "Wedding dresses aren't something you should be trying on."


Attending the Cloudspire Center gala was never high on Vincent's list. He'd only said yes because Brinley wanted his company, and her role as the manager required her to keep up appearances at these events. She'd asked for his help with gown shopping,and he'd agreed, thinking it was harmless. Now,standing here, he was caught off guard by how things had turned out.


Seeing his mood shift, Brinley quickly softened her tone, letting a bit of sadness show. "I'm sorry,Vincent. The dress just looked so pretty, and l wanted to try it on. That was all. I had no other intentions. I only wanted to know what I'd look like in a wedding gown. With my condition, I'm afraid I might not make it to my big day. I just thought maybe my dad and brother would like to see me dressed like this."

The tension from Vincent's expression softened,his jaw set with tension. "So, which one did you like?"
###Chapter 67 She's Victoria Hale


By the time the clock struck four, professionals from every corner of the business world had started filling Cloudspire Center.

Trailing after Rena and her father, Hannah found herself introduced to several key players from various industries. She understood well that most were only willing to exchange polite greetings because of the influence wielded by Brown Bank.

Even with that knowledge, Hannah treasured this opportunity. This evening marked the first time she'd truly seen how different this crowd was from her old life as a housewife.

With steady confidence, Hannah remarked, "Nova Tech will be a name everyone knows one day."

Glancing around the hall, she noticed plenty of skeptical and dismissive looks aimed her way. None of it bothered her, since she understood that this was just something she had to face. She quietly raised her champagne and took a sip.

Out of nowhere, a woman's voice cut through the noise. "Beautifully said." Her glass lifted in Hannah's direction, a warm smile on her face.

Hannah's gaze traveled upward, just as Rena leaned in and whispered, "That's Ms. Sloane Hadley-she's famous in the world of industrial business."

Moving through the crowd, Sloane's words carried both strength and encouragement. "I always appreciate the ambitious type."

Hannah was a little caught off guard by the praise. "Thank you, Ms. Hadley."

With a pat on Hannah's shoulder, Sloane suggested, "Let's swap numbers. I want to know about Nova Tech.Your company seems promising."

Right away, Hannah reached for her phone and exchanged contacts with Sloane, pleasantly surprised.Sloane was the first major figure she had connected with this evening. She lifted her glass once more."Thank you, Ms. Hadley. I promise you, Nova Tech will live up to your expectations."

Seeing the way Sloane welcomed Hannah, Rena could not hide her excitement. She clinked glasses with her friend several times, happy for her.

At that very moment, commotion broke out near the entrance.

Glancing in the direction of the uproar, Hannah spotted a man at the center-Miles had arrived.

The crowd, instantly drawn to Miles, gathered in close, eager for his attention.

Hannah didn't even try to push through. She held back, fully aware of her place in the room.

Rena glanced over and suddenly brightened, as if an idea struck her. She leaned close and whispered,"Hannah, have you ever wondered why someone like Miles would bother coming to an event like this?"

Hannah's brow furrowed in confusion. "Isn't this a business event? Since he's a big name now, I figured it made sense for him to be here."

"That's not it at all," Rena replied, shaking her head. "Usually, people like him would never show up for a minor gathering like this."

Dropping her voice even lower, Rena continued,"My dad told mne Miles is actually here because of Victoria-the founder behind that women's empowerment website. Five years ago, she created those sonic self-defense earrings that sold like crazy-no one's topped those sales since. My dad's tried recruiting her for ages, but Victoria remained elusive and hard to reach."

A part of Hannah wanted to admit she was actually Victoria right then. It wasn't exactly a secret worth guarding anymore.

But before she could say a word, a spotlight swept over the main stage, and the evening's host stepped up,script in hand. "Ladies and gentlemen," the host announced, his voice echoing through the room. "I know you have all been eagerly awaiting Victoria Hale. She's arrived backstage."

Hannah's gaze grew colder, fixed on the center of the stage.

The host lifted his voice with flair and instructed the crowd, "It's time to put your hands together for Victoria Hale!"

Rena clutched Hannah's hand in excitement."Oh my god!"

Lights shifted overhead as applause filled the hall. A woman in a white dress walked out, beaming,her arm entwined with a sharply dressed man.
Hannah and Rena both froze in shock when they saw Brinley's face.
 
###Chapter 68 Looks Like Wedding Bells Are On The Way


Rena's face twisted with disgust as she eyed Brinley. "Ugh. Why is it her?"

A buzz of chatter quickly spread through the crowd.

"Victoria is quite something else. Mr. Jones shows up for her sake."

"Looks like you all missed the news. Rumor has it that she was his first love, and now they're getting married."

"You can't be serious.For real?"

"As real as it gets. Search Mr. Jones' name online if you doubt me. Not long ago, his mistress made quite a stir online, targeting his first love. That mess was everywhere. What really surprised me is that the so-called first love turns out to be Victoria. With Victoria by Mr. Jonee's side, the Jones Group seems unstoppable."

Up on the stage, Brinley reached for themicrophone and gave the crowd a bright smile. "It's been a while since I saw all of you. l, Victoria Hale, am back." Her expression was full of excitement. "And my real name is Brinley Gilbert. I hope you'll all remember that."

The audience burst into cheers and clapping.

"Gee! Just the sight of her smug face makes my blood boil," Rena muttered through gritted teeth.

Hannah glared at Brinley, her eyes icy, astonished by Brinley's audacity to steal her hidden identity as Victoria and even make such a statement in public so brazenly.

"I want to apologize for being away for the past months," Brinley added, her voice ringing with emotion. "I had to deal with some health problems, but I'm feeling much better now. I've grown a lot during that time.From here on, I will focus on creating better safety products for women."

She spoke louder to make sure everyone heard her. "I owe so much to Mr. Jones. Since I came back from abroad, he's given me the best possible platform-Polaris Tech. This company is my fresh start. I hope, with his support, I can reach new heights."

While saying this, she sent Vincent a look full of admiration.

Rena shook with anger. She felt like charging toward the stage to expose Brinley's shamelessness, but Hannah quickly held her arm to keep her back.

"Hannah, you're not mad? They're flaunting their affair like you don't even exist! I'm fuming!" Rena hissed.

"Of course, I am furious," Hannah replied, her eyes growing even darker. But what truly set her off had nothing to do with their blatant display onstage. Watching Brinley parade around using her name Victoria was what pushed her over the edge. Brinley must bet that Victoria would never show up to expose her lies.

Calm and steady, Hannah kept her eyes fixed on the stage. "Just wait. The farther Brinley climbs, the harder it will be when she falls."

Rena was still seething and didn't notice the subtle change in Hannah's tone. "I just can't accept it. How could someone like Brinley possibly be Victoria?"

Hannah turned to her, arching a brow. "You really like Victoria, don't you?"

Rena hesitated for a second before admitting, "Not really. I just picked up some info about her from my dad.A woman that capable would never stoop to be a homewrecker."

Rena's attention went back to Brinley, who was soaking up the crowd's cheers. "Check Brinley's face. She's grinning so wide that you can see every wrinkle."

Hannah kept staring at the stage. Seeing Brinley bask in all that attention only made her feel the situation was even more absurd. Vincent would go out of his way to support Brinley's career, even attending events he clearly disliked just to back her.

Hannah had to suppress a bitter laugh at Vincent's approach toward her. He'd once insisted she should leave her job and settle into being a housewife. He'd even said to others that she never needed to work a day in her life, clearly a statement masking his unwillingness to support her career as he did for Brinley. How irony.

Turning away, Hannah finished off the champagne in her glass in one go.

It was then that Brinley and Vincent started walking over.

Close by, Hannah caught a playful remark. "Looks like we'll be hearing wedding bells soon for Mr. Jones and Miss Gilbert."

Brinley blushed and let out a shy laugh, staying silent instead of denying it.

Vincent appeared a little uncomfortable and seemed like he was about to respond, but a sharp female voice interrupted before he could.

Raising her voice loud enough for everyone to hear, Rena called out, "Mr. Jones, you changed your partner so quickly. I wonder how long this Miss Gilbert will stick around."

###Chapter 69 Questioned Her Identity


Very few people had ever challenged Vincent so openly. With a shaky hand, Gordon Brown, Rena's father,wiped sweat from his brow and gently pulled his daughter a step closer to him.

Vincent cast a cold glance at Rena. Without even sparing Gordon a look, he said, his voice low and heavy,"Mr. Brown, your daughter seems to need a reminder about when it's her turn to speak-and when silence would serve her better."

Quick to nod, Gordon rushed to agree. "You're right. I'Il make sure to discipline her properly. Rena, you need to apologize this instant."

His desperate glance at her begged for cooperation, but Rena acted ignorant of her father's unspoken message.

Rena shifted her head away and huffed, "I didn't say anything wrong. Why should I have to apologize at all?"

Vincent's expression barely changed as he looked at Rena. His voice was stripped of emotion. "In that case,the Browns should consider their partnership with the Jones Group over."

He turned on his heel and left, making no effort to hide his disdain.

"Wait, Mr.Jones!" Panic drove Gordon to chase after Vincent, dragging Rena with him.

Frozen in place, Hannah felt her heart turn cold. Vincent was clearly lashing out, punishing her by targeting the Browns. Determined to make things right, she slipped after Vincent, searching for even a small chance to talk. The Browns couldn't afford to lose this contract because of her.

But Brinley guided Vincent through the crowd so smoothly that Hannah never got close. Instead, her breath caught at what happened next.

Miles, the very person Hannah had hoped to cooperate with, extended a hand to Brinley with an easy smile."Victoria, I've heard so much about you. Meeting you at last feels long overdue."

Brinley was momentarily stunned by the striking man in front of her.

Vincent murmured to her, "This is Miles Whitaker, CEO of VitraMind."

Brinley quickly recovered and remarked, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.Whitaker."

Miles nodded, and his assistant, Kenneth, handed her a business card. "I have a strong interest in women's safety innovations. Hopefully, we'll find an opportunity to collaborate soon."

Brinley couldn't hide her delight as she accepted the business card with both hands. "I appreciate that so much,"she said.

Brinley turned to Vincent, whose eyes were shining with approval. Attending this event had turned out to be the right choice, surpassing her expectations.

Hannah took a quiet breath and pushed through the crowd. "Miss Gilbert, you claim you're Victoria. Do you have anything to prove it?"

The question rattled Brinley, and for an instant, panic flashed across her face.

A sidelong look from Miles revealed that he recognized Hannah as the neighbor from downstairs-the one who'd made a point to get close.

A champagne flute dangled from Vincent's hand as he fixed Hannah with a cold stare. "This isn't the moment for dramatics," he said, his tone biting.

Disregarding his warning, Hannah pressed on. "Last I checked, Victoria carries a seal engraved with her name. Do you have it, Miss Gilbert?"

Regaining her composure quickly, Brinley answered, "Yes... Yes, I have it."

Interest piqued, Miles, Sloane, and a handful of other guests now watched Brinley closely.

Vincent's eyes, however, stayed fixed on Hannah.

With a sly little smile, Hannah asked, "Is that so? In that case, would you mind showing it to us?"

An unamused look flickered on Brinley's face. "You really expect me to carry it to an event like this?"

Keeping her voice even, Brinley continued, "You questioned my identity in front of everyone, and I agree that proof is needed. I'd hate for someone else to take Victoria's name for themselves."

A laugh escaped Hannah, edged with sarcasm. She couldn't believe Brinley was actually suggesting she had bad intentions. The nerve of Brinley stealing her identity as Victoria while throwing accusations her way.

Hannah had just opened her mouth to argue when Brinley held up her phone. "If I weren't truly Victoria,how would I have been talking to those from the women's empowerment website all this time? Take a look for yourselves!"

###Chapter 70 Not Interested In Working With Someone Like You


Brinley held up her phone for everyone to see, the screen displaying a series of chat screenshots. "I might have kept my name out of the spotlight all these years, but I've always stayed in touch with the women on the website. Every year, I reach out," she said.

The device made its way from hand to hand among the crowd, drawing curious looks. Comments rippled through the room.

"These screenshots look real to me. The dates are all there-she's been keeping in contact for years."

"That seal must be ancient history. Maybe Miss Gilbert just forgot it."

"Could be. And come on, with Mr. Jones personally backing her-how could she not be the real deal?"

"Thinking back, Victoria's rise was so sudden... Makes you wonder if the Jones Group had her back from the start."

"You know, that's probably it."

The crowd gradually accepted Brinley's claim.

Brinley shot Hannah a smug glance, her expression triumphant.

Meeting that look with only a faint smile, Hannah replied, "Your evidence is certainly convincing.I suppose there's no question now-you really are Victoria. That means you've also got the custom seal. Am I right?"

Brinley, pleased by Hannah's apparent concession,lifted her chin. "Of course, I do. Something that valuable has always been in my care."

At that, Miles furrowed his brow and gave Brinley a sidelong glance.

Hannah's lips curved into a subtle, icy smile. Did Brinley really think she could pass herself off as Victoria without even doing her homework? Her tone turned cool and sharp. "That's interesting because the real Victoria never owned a seal with her name on it."

A wave of shock rooted Brinley to the spot.

Slowly, Hannah angled her head, her tone even and steady. "If you were truly Victoria, wouldn't you know this? Years ago, so-called 'official Victoria seals' started popping up for sale. People scrambled to get their hands on them. But Victoria wasted no time and immediately made it clear-she never approved any of it.She issued a public denial for all to see."

Reason guided Hannah's words. Her voice was measured and quiet, but the weight behind it was unmistakable. Murmurs rippled through the crowd as uncertainty began to take hold.

Brinley's fists tightened at her sides. Her jaw clenched as she hadn't expected Hannah to turn the tables by setting her up.

Vincent, who'd been watching Hannah, slowly redirected his focus to Brinley. His features gave nothing away.



Catching his eye, Brinley straightened her posture and moved to face him. Relief crept in when his gaze revealed no clear sign of disappointment or disdain. She explained in a rush, "I meant well then. Those imitation seals were ridiculously expensive. Buyers snapped them up because of me. I just didn't think it was right."

Wanting to sound sincere, she added, "Honesty, I was just looking out for everyone else."

The corners of Hannah's mouth curled as she started to clap her hands slowly. She didn't break eye contact with Brinley. "How thoughtful of you. Since you remember that, I'm sure you can also recall exactly what Victoria said in her official statement."

Looking away, Brinley's confidence faltered. "It was just something like telling people not to buy, wasn't it?"

"Oh?" Hannah stepped forward, narrowing the gap between them.

Brinley retreated almost automatically. "I... I'm not certain of the exact words."

"Not sure, huh?" Hannah's gaze sharpened, her words icy and pointed."Or maybe you just never were Victoria at all?"

No answer came from Brinley. Her lips moved, but nothing escaped. The crowd's whispers picked up,feeding her anxiety and making the room feel smaller.

Panic nearly overwhelmed Brinley as she found herself pinned against the bar-until Vincent intervened,reaching out to move her safely aside.

Vincent's voice sliced through the tension. "That's enough, Hannah," he said, his tone icy.
Hannah stopped in her tracks as she caught the unmistakable protectiveness in Vincent's stance. With a slight tug at her lips, she let a cool smile surface. "Mr. Jones, I'm only pressing Miss Gilbert for a little clarification, just to keep things transparent for everyone here. Yet, you're so quick to defend her-don't you think you're overdoing it?"

A shadow flickered across Vincent's face.

Unfazed, Hannah held his gaze, refusing to back down.

Brinley bit her lip, feeling the weight of all the eyes fixed on her. Her heart raced wildly. Suddenly,she pressed her hand to her chest, squeezed her eyes shut, and collapsed straight into Vincent's arms.

A wave of shock spread through the onlookers. "What just happened?"

Vincent's expression darkened. He sent Hannah a blistering look, scooped Brinley up, and strode out of the room without so much as a word to anyone else.

The room quickly descended into chaos, with guests demanding an explanation.

Sweat gathered on the event organizer's brow as he tried to reassure the crowd, "Miss Gilbert is Victoria, I assure you!" But as more doubts were raised, his confidence visibly faltered.

A smirk threatened at the edges of Hannah's expression as she watched Vincent disappear with Brinley.The entire display struck her as nothing short of absurd.

Pivoting away, Hannah caught sight of Miles already making for the door. Wasting no time, she moved to catch up. "Mr.Whitaker,wait."

Miles turned, his expression barely concealing his impatience the moment he saw her.

Hannah offered her business card. "I overheard you earlier-your interest in female safety products. My team is currently-"

"I'm not interested in working with someone like you," Miles cut her off flatly.

###Chapter 71 Take Five Percent Off


Hannah's polite smile faltered for a second. Conflicting feelings surged-hurt, annoyance, and the sharp sting of being wrongly judged. What exactly did Miles mean by "someone like you?" The words echoed,heavier than she'd expected. Never had she imagined the man she'd met only twice would have already slapped a label on her, making sweeping assumptions about her character.

Despite that sting, Hannah straightened and smoothed her expression. She spoke with poise. "Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding-"

Yet, Miles refused to hear her out. Without so much as a glance, he strode away.

Hannah gathered up her dress and picked up the pace to catch up. She moved in front of him, walking backward to match his pace. "Listen, Mr. Whitaker, mny abilities match Brinley's, if not exceed them. Give Nova Tech one shot-I'll even sweeten the deal. Take five percent off, plus an even split on the profits. You won't regret it."

A low, mirthless laugh escaped Miles as he halted. His eyes glinted with equal parts amusement and challenge. "That's gutsy. Tell me, do you realize what five percent actually means in a deal like this?"

Numbers and bottom lines weren't lost on Hannah. Granting such a discount would eat into Nova Tech's margins, barely leaving enough after development and production. Still, she held his gaze without flinching.She answered with resolve, "Five percent represents commitment. The real question is-are you open to seeing what we can do?"

Something about her fierce confidence gave Miles pause. For a brief moment, he hesitated. But his silence stretched,and without a word, he sidestepped her, vanishing into the crowd.

Not long after, Miles settled into his Porsche and addressed Kenneth without turning his head, "Find out everything about Nova Tech."

"Understood. Is this for a new partnership?"

"No," Miles answered, his voice cold enough to freeze steel. He just wanted to know what kind of company dared to offer him terms like that.

Elsewhere, Derek gripped the steering wheel, pressing harder on the gas as sweat trickled down his temple.Every nerve was on edge. His boss looked ready to explode.

In the backseat, Vincent ripped his tie loose, hands trembling with agitation. His thoughts spiraled into chaos.

He'd heard the name "Victoria Hale" back in college. It had floated around a few times, but he'd never cared enough to dig deeper. He didn't even know what exactly Victoria did.

So, when Brinley revealed she was Victoria, he'd been a little surprised-but also genuinely happy for her.It meant she had something to strive for, a real career, and that was a good thing. That was why, when she'd asked him to accompany her on stage, he hadn't refused.

Nothing, however, could have prepared him for Hannah's unexpected presence-or for the storm she'd stirred up.

Wearily, Vincent pressed his fingers to his forehead. Lately, he felt he really didn't understand Hannah. As for Victoria? He couldn't care less. Brinley's well-being-that was what mattered. She couldn't afford to go through another spell like this.

Eyes squeezed shut, Brinley tried to control her breathing to keep up her charade, silently counting the seconds. Letting Derek drive her all the way to the ER was out of the question. If doctors started running tests, her lies about the supposed heart condition would unravel right there.

Easing her eyes open, Brinley put on a look of confusion, glancing around as if she had just woken up from a coma. "Vincent? Weren't we just at the event? Why are we driving somewhere?"

Seeing her awake, Vincent's tension visibly eased. "You fainted, so we're on our way to the hospital. Let's hear what the doctors have to say about this."

Brinley sat up quickly, clutching his arm with a soft whimper. "Vincent, could we not go to the hospital? I really dislike it."

Vincent's reply was brisk and emotionless. "We're not skipping it. Hospital, Brinley." He figured that heart condition couldn't be dismissed.

Trying to hide her rising panic, Brinley clung tighter. "Honestly, I'm feeling much better. Lately, I've spent more time in hospitals than anywhere else. I seriously dislike the notion of visiting the hospital."

But Vincent's expression remained stern, his tone brooking no argument. "No changes. Hospital. That's final."

She instantly switched tactics and softened her voice. "Didn't the doctor say my mood matters most?Hospitals depress me. The smell of antiseptic alone ruins it for me. And I hate being at the hospital-it just reminds me I'm a patient who needs to be taken care of."

He stayed unmoved. "We'll only be in the hospital for a short time. This isn't up for debate."

Realizing his stance hadn't shifted an inch, Brinley resorted to her last card. Discreetly pinching her thigh,she made her voice tremble. "Vincent, hospitals bring back every awful memory. My father and my brother both died in places like that.It scares me."

Turning his head, Vincent let his gaze drift to the window. The flicker of emotion in his eyes was impossible to read.

For a heartbeat, Brinley let her voice falter. "If I'd known you'd worry like this, I never would've told you about my heart condition at all. Nobody knows my limits better than I do."

Vincent stayed silent for a while before he finally said, "Fine. Derek, drive us back."

###Chapter 72 Your Wife Ran Off


Brinley curled her lips in satisfaction. She knew it-Vincent would give in eventually. As she replayed the gala in her mind, her fury simmered beneath the surface. The audacity of Hannah, shaming her in public like that,right in front of Vincent, no less!

With careful calculation, Brinley squeezed out a few convincing tears and gave Vincent a wounded look."Vincent, I never meant to keep my being Victoria from you. I just couldn't figure out how to explain it. And at the gala-I had no clue why Hannah came after me like that. The way she went after me... It was humiliating. People jumped to conclusions and whispered things that aren't true. My heart pounded so fast that I just blacked out."

"Don't mind Hannah's antics," Vincent said calmly, idly twisting his wedding ring as he bent his knee.

To him, Hannah's behavior was just another recent outburst. He had dismissed everything she'd said at the gala without a second thought.

Relief washed over Brinley, her spirits rising. The meaning behind Vincent's words was clear-he was taking her side. Her place in Vincent's heart was unshakable, no matter what chaos Hannah created.

Their drive ended ten minutes later at the gates of the Jones family estate.

Eager to move ahead, Brinley stepped from the car first, her ears catching Vincent's quiet conversation with Derek. His instructions were clear-Derek was to go fetch Hannah from Cloudspire Center.

Instantly, Brinley's smile faded. What had Hannah done to deserve special treatment? Before jealousy could take root, she composed herself, plastering on her sweetest smile as Vincent approached.

Inside the entryway, Vincent and Brinley were greeted by Sharon, settled on the living room sofa.

Sharon usually tended to her garden, challenged someone to chess, and took long walks. Thus, her stillness on the sofa was jarring.

A shadow crossed Sharon's face as soon as they appeared. "Why is it just the two of you?"

Tension laced her words, hinting at an obvious disappointment at someone's presence.

Brinley knew Sharon implied she was not welcome. Her lips parted to respond, but Sharon had already fixed Vincent with a glare and jabbed a finger in his direction. "Didn't I tell you to bring your wife home? Where is she? Are you ignoring my words now?"

Nothing ever rattled the powerful CEO ofthe Jones Group-except his grandmother's scolding. With her,Vincent had no choice but to listen in silence.

Dragging a tired hand across his forehead, Vincent let himself slump into the cushions. "Derek's already on his way to pick her up," he muttered.

Sharon jabbed him in the arm. "You little rascal. That's your idea of winning your wife over? That's your wife,and you send your assistant to bring her home?"

Vincent was at a loss for words.

Brinley sat stiffly beside them, listening to the entire conversation revolving around Hannah, as though she didn't exist. She pressed her teeth into her bottom lip, swallowing her frustration, but kept quiet. Sharon's anger was written all over her face. Staying silent was the only safe move.

A sudden ringtone cut through the tension. Vincent glanced at his phone. Derek was calling.

Expecting a report of having fetched Hannah, Vincent put the call on speaker, making sure Sharon could listen in.

Sharon leaned in.

"Derek, put Hannah on the line," Vincent instructed.

On the other end, Derek sounded bewildered. "Mr. Jones, your wife has already left. I didn't see her."

Vincent's face turned cold in an instant. He let out a short, bitter laugh before hanging up.

Sharon's eyes sparkled with a silent "I told you so."

Uncertainty darkened Vincent's features. Hannah had left the gala. She wasn't coming home.Where had she disappeared to?

The tap of Sharon's cane against the floor punctuated her annoyance. "Didn't I warn you? Your wife ran off.And another thing-Hannah is your wife, not some business contact. Why are you hiding behind your assistant instead of speaking to her yourself? Marriage isn't handled by delegation,Vincent."

A storm seemed to pass over Vincent's face. Even phone calls didn't reach Hannah-she'd gone as far as blocking his number.

Sharon let out a weary sigh. "You two were never like this before. What on earth did you do to upset her so badly?"

###Chapter 73 Eight Days Left


A tightness gripped Vincent's throat, so he tried steering the conversation away. "Grandma, maybe it's time for you to rest.Aubrey-"

A sharp glare from Sharon cut him off. "Only call for Aubrey when it's convenient for you, huh? Don't bother.I'm not leaving this spot until my granddaughter-in-law is back in this house."

Listening from the sidelines, Brinley could only seethe as Sharon repeated "your wife" and "my granddaughter-in-law," all pointing at Hannah. The words burned, each one a reminder of what she believed should have belonged to her.

"Hannah won't be coming back," Vincent remarked with a frustrated sigh. "Didn't Derek say he couldn't find her?" A frown creased his face. "She's been running around for days. I have no idea when she'll bother to return."

Sharon fixed him with a pointed look. "That's because she wanted to steer clear of you. I have already rang her up. She promised she'd come back soon," she said, clearly enjoying the upper hand.

A fresh wave of irritation settled over Vincent.

A slow, meaningful smile curved Sharon's lips. "Hannah really cares about me. She actually listens, unlike my grandson, who tunes me out completely."

Vincent felt each word hit home, their sting impossible to shake.

Brinley, sensing the tension, was about to speak-when the door opened. Hannah walked in.

Brinley's shoulders tensed, and her words dried up instantly.

One step into the living room, Hannah paused, surprised by the presence of Vincent and Brinley. She had assumed they wouldn't be here, but since they looked perfectly at ease, she decided not to back down.After all, she wasn't the shameless homewrecker or the unfaithful spouse here.She did nothing wrong to be uneasy about.

A while back, after saying goodbye to Rena post-gala, Hannah had gotten a call from Sharon,asking her to come home, and she hadn't hesitated.

Vincent's eyes barely left Hannah from the moment she crossed the entrance-barely noticeable,but persistent.


Catching his stare from the corner of her eye, Hannah made a point of ignoring him entirely.

"Sharon, I'm home," Hannah called out, her return motivated by a desire to spare Sharon, already in her seventies, from the stress of watching her and Vincent's mnarriage unravel. She had assumed that Vincent and Brinley would be away, but seeing them here didn't bother her in the slightest. There were only eight days left. After that, she and Vincent would have nothing to do with each other.

Tonight, Hannah's focus was on Sharon and nothing else. "How abouta walk, Sharon? Let's get some air,"she suggested warmly.

With a gentle laugh, Sharon waved off the idea."Why rush? Didn't you mention you had planned for my birthday? Now that everyone's gathered, show us what you've got."

Taking charge, Sharon tugged Hannah down beside her, wedging Hannah right between herself and Vincent. Hannah's leg brushed against Vincent's due to the limited space.

Discomfort flashed through Hannah as she shot to her feet, unable to hide the look of distaste thatcrossed her face.

Expression tight and cold, Vincent said nohing, simply staring at her.

His mood was plain to see. Hannah felt it, but didn't let it touch her. No more would she let his moods decide her actions. That included something as simple as sitting within arm's reach.

With a pleasant smile, Hannah excused herself. "I'Il be right back, Sharon. Just need to grab my laptop," she said, already heading for the stairs as she was eager to put some distance between herself and Vincent.

She hurried to her room, heading straight for the desk. The curtains were drawn and the lights were off,casting the room in a dim hush.

Something about the layout seemed to have changed, but she didn't pay it much attention.
###Chapter 74 She's Not An Outsider


Descending the stairs with her laptop, Hannah found Danica already settled in the living room, engaged in friendly conversation with Brinley.

Making no effort to greet them, Hannah slipped quietly onto the sofa beside Sharon and began powering up her computer, ready to present her ideas-only to be interrupted by Vincent. "If I'm not mistaken, Brinley's in charge of this birthday celebration planning."

For a second, Hannah sat frozen, a wave of powerlessness washing over her. Her gaze narrowed on Vincent.He really was determined to deny her even the smallest bit of respect. He understood exactly how much Sharon meant to her.

Danica chimed in, "Exactly. Hannah, you're just helping this year. Don't get your roles mixed up." Linking arms with Brinley, she smiled. "Brinley, you have crafted a plan, right? Why don't you run upstairs and grab your laptop to show it to Sharon?"

With a well-practiced look of embarrassment, Brinley nodded and hurried upstairs.

Bewilderment flickered across Sharon's face as she glanced back and forth between Hannah and Danica."What's going on? Hasn't Hannah always organized my birthday?"

Vincent said nothing, cold eyes occasionally settling on Hannah with an unspoken warning.

Not missing a beat, Danica tried to smooth things over. "Brinley's just returned from overseas and wanted to do something special for you. It's your seventieth birthday, after all. Hannah has planned every celebration until now-surely she won't mind letting someone else take a turn."

A sharp crack in Sharon's voice cut through the room. "Nonsense. Tell me-who is Brinley to us?"

Danica froze, at a loss for words.

With a determined push, Sharon stood, gripping her cane tightly. Her glare never wavered. "Brinley doesn't belong to this family. She's not one of us. But Hannah is my granddaughter-in-law. And you want to put my birthday in the hands of an outsider? What exactly were you thinking?"

Danica had always been a little intimidated by Sharon. Now, she didn't dare say a word.

Hannah lifted her head, emotiontightening her chest as she watched Sharon defend her so fiercely. Deep down, she had always known-no one in tis house truly cared about her except Sharon.

Meanwhile, Brinley was making her way down from the third floor when she caught the tail of Sharon's words. A sharp pang twisted in her chest. That single word, outsider, was alI Sharon had ever seen her as.

Breaking the tension, Vincent spoke up, massaging his temple. "Grandma, Brinley isn't some outsider."

Sharon's fury turned toward him. "Don't even get me started on you, Vincent! You just stood there and let your wife be reduced to an assistant to an outsider? Is this how you treat your own wife?"

Every bit of bitterness and scorn flickered in Hannah's gaze. The answer was obvious to anyone watching-Vincent's heart was with Brinley.

Words of self-defense nevercame from Vincent. He absorbed the criticism, silent and unmoving.

Once Sharon had said her piece, Vincent answered in a low voice, "You're blowing this out of proportion.They each came up with a plan, so you can just take a look at both." He left the decision squarely in Sharon's hands. "Pick whichever you like best. It's upto you."

Danica muttered to herself, "We've already settled that Brinley would take charge."

One cold stare from Sharon silenced her. "Don't forget, none of you even bothered to ask me before deciding my birthday would be run by someone outside the family. Still want to argue? Then go ahead with the celebration without me."

That was enough to keep Danica quiet.

Every fresh defeat for Danica brought a trace of laughter to Hannah's lips. A turn of her head put her face-to-face with Vincent. Whatever amusement she felt evaporated, replaced by a wry,dismissive smile.

Vincent caught every nuance. His gaze grew colder, sharper than ever.

At this point, Brinley glided back downstairs, laptop in hand, pretending to have missed all the tension. She wedged herself between Sharon and Vincent with practiced ease.

Rising almost instantly, Vincent stepped aside. "I'll let you all talk."

Brinley and Hannah each presented their own plan for the birthday celebration. Sharon listened closely,questions sharp and probing, like a CEO testing her board.
 
Responses came readily. Brinley's answers were polished, but Hannah's were thoughtful and exacting.

When it came time to choose, Sharon made her preference clear. Hannah's proposal won, hands down.

###Chapter 75 The Room For Their Future Life


"I'm leaning toward Hannah's proposal." Sharon reached over and gave Hannah's hand a gentle pat. "Thank you for your effort."

A bright smile lit up Hannah's face. "I'm really glad you like it, Sharon."

Hannah pulled Sharon into a warm hug, even nestling her face against Sharon's shoulder.

Anyone watching would have found the moment truly touching.

Vincent looked on, feeling a stab of unease. That kind of smile from Hannah hadn't been directed at him for a very long time.

When Sharon was in the room, Danica never had a say. Instead, she placed a comforting hand on Brinley's shoulder.She figured that once Hannah wrapped up the divorce procedure and left the Jones family behind,Brinley would have plenty of opportunities to shine. For now, it didn't hurt to let Hannah enjoy her victory,just one birthday celebration.

Danica felt no concern at all.

The sting of disappointment settled in Brinley's chest, her nails pressing hard into her palms. "Sharon, why did you choose Hannah's plan over mine? I spent four days working on my own plan. How could you dismiss my plan as less thoughtful?"

Tears crept into Brinley's words. "You've watched me grow up. I have viewed you as my grandmother. I just wanted to do something that would bring you happiness, but you make me feel like I don't belong, like I'm just some outsider." Her tone was filled with hurt.

A mocking smile played at the corners of Hannah's mouth. The divorce wasn't even final, yet Brinley already pictured herself as a true member of the Jones family.

Brinley's emotional plea didn't move Sharon at all. Sharon's expression stayed stern and composed. "But you are indeed an outsider. At best, you're the child of a late friend. Since you left for overseas, we've hardly been in contact, and that's the full extent of our relationship. You don't need to, and you don't have the right to plan my birthday celebration."

Pausing to let her words sink in, she added, "Also, there are only eight days until my birthday party. Many of Hannah's arrangements are already set in motion, while your ideas are still in the early stages. You suggested a lawn party, but the venue needs to be booked a month ahead. Clearly, you haven't followed up with your proposal. In every way, Hannah's plan is more suitable."

Speechless, Brinley could only look toward Vincent for help. Her voice cracked. "Vincent, I really did put my heart into this..."

Vincent's jaw tightened as he spoke."My grandma has the final say."

A heavy silence settled over the room.

Biting her lip, Brinley muttered, "You're all against me because my father and brother are gone,"then hurried upstairs in tears.

Her outburst left the rest of the group exchanging uneasy looks.

Danica leaned closer to Vincent and gave him a nudge. "Vincent, shouldn't you go after Brinley? She might need someone right now."

Vincent shot a sharp look in Hannah's direction, his eyes sending a silent warning.

Hannah understood immediately. Vincent blamed her for having Sharon's support, making his first love upset.What a twisted logic. Bitterness flickered at the corners of her mouth.

Vincent was just about to walk toward the stairs when Sharon stopped him with a raised hand. "Stay here.The one you should be accompanying now is your wife," she said sternly.

The thought of Vincent's company made Hannah's skin prickle. She wanted no part of it.

A chill crept into Vincent's reply. "Grandma, Brinley's not well. She fainted just earlier, and being scolded in front of everyone probably made her upset. I have to go check on her."

A wave of exhaustion washed over Hannah. Brinley's heart condition seemed to give her power over Vincent.


Hannah's heart had been numb for so long that she couldn't feel the pain anymore. Fortunately, she was about to divorce Vincent, and this wouldn't last much longer.

Sharon made another attempt to stop Vincent, but Hannah reached out and gently squeezed Sharon's

hand. "It's aIright, Sharon. Let him go."

Vincent made his way upstairs.

Trailing close behind, Danica wore a satisfied smirk. The truth was plain-Vincent's concern belonged to Brinley. Not even Sharon's support would keep Hannah from being kicked out once the birthday party ended.
After soothing Sharon, Hannah made her way back up to her room on the second floor. The moment she stepped inside, she sensed something was wrong.

Nothing looked the same anymore. The crib that once sat in the corner had vanished without a trace.

She glanced around and saw that her dried flowerframe was no longer on the vanity table. Even the bed that Vincent had specially brought had been replaced by something new.

Instead of the calm, simple décor she loved, the whole space now felt extravagant and overly feminine.Gone were the mist-blue curtains she and Vincent had chosen together, replaced now with a glaring shade of pink.

Everything,from the wardrobe to the sofa to the makeup table, had been swapped out for something else.

Tears stung Hannah's eyes. One single day away, and Vincent hadn't wasted any time making the room unrecognizable, erasing the life they had built together. It made sense now why he was out shopping for wedding dresses with Brinley. He had already redecorated the room for his future life with Brinley.

The bitterness in Hannah's eyes grew sharper. For someone like Vincent, she had been nothing more than a temporary stand-in, explaining his lack of hesitation in shattering the rare, shared sweetness from their past.

But it didn't matter. Since he had already transformed the room holding the precious memories, she refused to hang onto it.

After a few paces, she turned around and hurried toward the bed. Her suspicion was confirmed-the diary she'd hidden was nowhere to be found. That diary, which held the whole story of how she met Vincent,how she fell in love, and eventually married him, had vanished.

At first, she'd kept it at the house in Lakeshore Villa. But once Brinley had paid a visit there, Hannah had moved it to the Jones family estate instead. It was supposed to be a keepsake, but it was lost in the end.Maybe it was better this way. She had already made up her mind to get a divorce from Vincent. No point dwelling on it.

Hannah slung her bag over her shoulder, walked to the door, and reached for the handle.

As soon as she pulled the door open, Vincent appeared right in front of her,about to enter.

He gave her one look, clearly displeased to find her ready to leave. "It's late," he said coldly. "Where are you planning to go?"

###Chapter 76 Just Right For Your Next Wedding Night


Catching sight of Vincent blocking the doorway, Hannah's expression immediately hardened. "That's not your concern." With a determined push, she brushed past him, making a beeline for the hallway.

A storm brewed in Vincent's eyes as he caught her bythe arm and dragged her back, the door thudding shut behind them. His sleeve rolled up, he shot her a pointed look. "You're not leaving," he ordered, voice crisp and unyielding.

Hannah fixed him with a frosty stare. She paused for a moment before letting out a sharp scoff. "Was it really necessary for you to be this heartless?"

She smirked. What did he expect-was he seriously going to force her to stay in this room and witness his happiness with Brinley? She was hardly interested in watching.

Anger flared inside Hannah, each breath coming sharper than the last.

A crease appeared between Vincent's brows as he studied her, frustration clear. Recently, he found himself at a loss every time they spoke. Danica's presence upstairs with Brinley was the only reason he'd cut his visit short-only to catch Hannah about to slip away. And on top of that, Hannah's icy tone stung. She wasn't like this before.

Frustration made his tone harsh. "You already have full control over the birthday celebration planning. What more do you want?"

"Sharon gave me that responsibility. What does that have to do with you?" Hannah retorted. Brinley was the only one Vincent ever seemed willing to defend.

Eyes shining with biting sarcasm, Hannah raised her chin, refusing to back down. "Get out of my way."

Vincent's tone sank lower, rough and tight, like every word had to be forced past his jaw. "I am not moving.Say it. What the hell's been going on with you these days?"

Hannah had to suppress an eye roll. Unbelievable. Now he wanted answers, after everything he'd put her through? No reply came. Wasting breath on him felt pointless, every second in this room pressing down on her. All she wanted was to escape.

Hannah didn't flinch. She lifted a hand and motioned toward the freshly redone bedroom behind her, her tone dripping with biting sarcasm. "From whereI'm standing, it looks like you're the eager one to walk away from this marriage."

Folding her arms, she let her voice shift to something cold and detached., for you to remarry soon,I'd recommend setting aside time to wrap up our divorce."

The words landed hard, each one stinging like a slap. Vincent's jaw tightened, a pulse hammering at his temple, and his breath started to come in heavy bursts.

She could tell he was seething. It didn't matter. She turned her head away and stared at the wall.

Then came his voice again, quiet but sharpwith strain. "Hannah, do you really want a divorce that badly?"

###Chapter 77 | Am Not Divorcing You


Vincent's voice came through, filled with a quiet sincerity.

When Hannah glanced up, she caught sight of a storm of emotions swirling in his eyes. A trace of reluctance lingered there, almost hidden, but she noticed. That could not be right, could it?

Shaking her head, Hannah pushed the thought away. Why would Vincent hesitate to end things with her now? With Brinley's return, their marriage had a clear expiration date. The only reason he hadn't broached the subject yet was because of his grandmother.

Matching his seriousness, Hannah remarked, "Vincent, let's not even mention those three years we dated.Just focus on the five years we've been married. Can you recall a single moment where we were truly happy together?"

Vincent responded, "I can." He believed their days had passed by smoothly, free of real arguments, and that calmness equaled happiness.

Yet,Hannah gave a bitter laugh, her lips curling into a half-smile. "That's not true for me. Through these five years, I can't recall any happiness. If anything, marrying you has brought me nothing but heartache."

Shock flickered in Vincent's eyes, and all color drained from his face. He opened his mouth to speak, his throat working, but no words came out. So, that was how Hannah saw their years together?

Hannah's gaze fell to her lap as she reflected. Five years felt like a lifetime. She'd been called a home wrecker and even scorned by those in high society while she was actually Vincent's rightful wife. Danica had never hidden her contempt, and Vincent had rarely come home to care. For ages, she'd barely dared to leave their house. The latest blow had been her parents' worry about her marriage.

She realized that each heartbreak and every bit of loneliness-all because she became Vincent's wife. If they had married for love, it might have been bearable, but the truth was, this marriage lacked love entirely.Vincent's heart was never hers. She had always just filled a vacancy.

If she had never chased after him all those years ago, maybe she could have spared herself all this pain.Regret pressed heavily on her heart. If only she'd never crossed paths with Vincent, perhaps her world would be less complicated.

"I'm not divorcing you." Only after a long pause did those words finally break free, the strain obvious in his tone.

Rolling her eyes, Hannah didn't take his statement seriously. Of course, he would marry Brinley someday.The divorce was inevitable.

Nothing in Hannah's expression betrayed any feeling. "Move out of my way."

"Where do you think you're headed?" Vincent's brow creased as he watched her.

Hannah found it amusing that he'd asked her the same question twice, as if on purpose.

"I don't know what you expect from me, Vincent," Hannah replied, unable to hide her irritation."Doyou really want me to sleep in a bed you saved for your future life with Brinley?"

"You're not leaving this room. This is where you'll sleep," Vincent insisted, refusing to budge.

"That's ridiculous. There's no chance I'm staying in here," Hannah retorted, her anger bubbling over.

In a flash, she raised her knee, feigning a kick, but Vincent stepped aside with ease.

Seizing her chance, she slipped through the open door. Being in the same room with Vincent made the air suffocating. With her back to him, she said, "Starting today, I'll sleep in the guest room."

She resolved that after his grandmother's birthday, she wouldn't return to this place.

Without waiting for a response, she marched across the hall, pushed open the guest room door, and shut it behind her without looking back.

Vincent, left standing alone, leaned heavily against the door, his throat burning. He'd given up cigarettes when they started trying for a baby. But now, irritation gnawed at him. He found himself reaching for a cigarette from the drawer, lighting it with trembling hands.

Smoke quickly filled the room, making it impossible to read the turmoil in Vincent's eyes.

Upstáirs, Danica caught the sounds drifting up from below and couldn't resist spying from the stairwell.Upon discovering that Hannah and Vincent would be spending the night in separate rooms, she couldn't have been happier.

Within moments, Danica rushed off, eager to share the good news with Brinley.
###Chapter 78 Probably Out Seeing Other Men


For Danica, losing ten properties was a blow she couldn't forget. A storm of frustration churned within her,and every time Hannah's name popped into her mind, her hands started to shake. No one would have been surprised by how much she wanted to lash out.

Thus, Danica had targeted the second-floor bedroom, the very room Hannah had poured her heart into decorating. Everyone in the family knew Hannah's one request: the arrangement in that room was to remain untouched.

Danica had been set on getting back at Hannah, no matter how petty it seemed.

Each tear or frown from Hannah only fueled Danica's sense of victory.

Meanwhile, Brinley, who had quietly listened to Danica's words, began to feel a bit lighter. The sadness that clung to her after Vincent's hasty exit finally faded. "Mrs. Jones, I'm grateful for your support," she whispered, her voice soft as silk.

"Oh, you don't need to thank me for anything," Danica replied, a warm smile spreading across her face."I went ahead and redid that bedroom to your taste. You'll absolutely adore it. It's just right for you and Vincent once you're married."

A shy smile played on Brinley's lips, but shadows passed through her eyes as she remembered every incident-from the gala's chaos to the tense moments at the Jones family estate.

···

Sleep had barely touched Vincent last night. Dawn found him wandering downstairs, only to discover Sharon and Danica already gathered around the breakfast table.

Puling out a chair, Vincent sat down and sent a glance toward Aubrey."Where's Hannah?" he asked, almost as an afterthought.

Aubrey answered promptly, "She left before sunrise."

Without missing a beat, Danica chimed in, "I have no clue what keeps Hannah so busy lately. It's like she's never home anymore."

Sharon shot her a look. "If Hannah is out, then she clearly has her reasons. Instead of gossiping, why don't you find something useful to do around here?"

Danica muttered to herself, "She's a housewife, not a businesswoman. What could she possibly be so busy with? She's probably out seeing other men."

Both Vincent and Sharon picked up every word, despite Danica's low voice.

Sharon slammed her spoon onto the table with a loud clatter. "If you keep spouting nonsense at breakfast,you can eat somewhere else. From now on, we'll eat in separate roomns."

Danica fell silent.

Across the table, Vincent showed nothing. He nursed his coffee, adjusted his jacket, and then strode out without a backward glance.

Outside, Derek waited near the curb, checking his watch.

Not a second passed after Vincent slid into the back seat before Derek took note of his haggard appearance. "You didn't get a wink of sleep, did you,Mr.Jones?"

A faint crease formed between Vincent's brows, and he gave a low grunt in response.

"Mr. Jones, no matter how packed your schedule is, you can't neglect your health. Your grandmother's holding onto hope that you'll start a family soon."

Vincent shot Derek a look, calm but chilling.

In an instant, Derek decided it was better not to say another word.

The drive went on in silence until Vincent broke it, gaze still fixed on the passing scenery. "I'll send you a layout sketch later. Purchase the materials exactly as specified-color, dimensions, style. Everything has to match. I want my bedroom on the second floor redone to those exact specifications."

"Understood," Derek replied, his tone brisk and unquestioning.

Arriving at the office, Vincent was immediately met by Clive's eager announcement. "Mr. Jones, Miss Gilbert's been waiting in your office for a while."

Trailing after Vincent, Clive added, "Oh, and here is the custom ring you ordered."
Vincent took the dainty band, holding it up against his own ring finger. "This is too loose by a millimeter.I specified sixteen, not seventeen. Redo it."

Panic flickered in Clive's eyes. At that time, he had let his excitement get ahead of him and asked Brinley for the size instead, assuming it would be close enough. Never had he thought Vincent would catch such a tiny difference.

Vincent didn't give him another glance. When he entered his office, Brinley stepped forward to greet him.He cut straight to the point."Why are you here?"
###Chapter 79 Acquired Nova Tech


A thick folder labeled "Nova Tech Acquisition Plan" landed on the table as Brinley set it before Vincent.

Vincent met her eyes, curiosity piqued. "You want to acquire this company?"

"That's right." Without hesitation, Brinley shared her reasoning. "Nova Tech and Polaris Tech have always been rivals, but Nova's product line is far more developed. If we move fast and bring their assets under our umbrella, it gives Polaris Tech a real edge and could help us lock in future deals with VitraMind. Moreover,Nova Tech recently declared bankruptcy, presenting a timely opportunity for acquisition."

Still feeling the sting from Hannah's public humiliation at the gala, Brinley was eager to prove her capabilities and solidify her persona as "Victoria" to silence the doubters for good.

Acquiring another company and taking over their products was the quickest way Brinley could think of.It wasn't just about their products.Nova Tech had once hit the big time. Acquiring it meant she could parade its past success as her own achievement.

There was one snag-Brinley didn't have enough funds to make the acquisition, which was why she brought her pitch to Vincent.

A hint of anxiety crept into Brinley's voice. "Vincent, what do you think?"

Vincent considered her proposal, eyebrows lifted in mild surprise. "That's a bold plan."

He spent a moment leafing through the acquisition documents before finally responding,"It's worth a try."Excitement lit up Brinley's face.


···

A sleepless night weighed heavily on Hannah, who reached Nova Tech before anyone else.

Yesterday's encounter with Miles at the gala had only fueled her determination to prove what Nova Tech could really do. The priority was to produce the hormone detection wristband after wrapping up its design.

Rena revealed that in a few days, there would be an open bidding opportunity for VitraMind. If Miles took a liking to their product, securing a partnership would be a sure thing.
Felix noticed the dark circles beneath Hannah's eyes, along with her relentless energy as she dove straight into work.

When lunchtime rolled around, fretting she might skip the meal altogether, Felix dragged her to his office to dine together. Yet, even throughout the meal, she kept the conversation focused on product features and improvements.

Felix's office had a small lounge with a bed meant for resting. Worried about her burning out, he suggested,"After lunch, you should lie down and recharge-it's lunch break, after all."

Hannah said, "I'm not tired. I want to update the wristband's algorithm after the meal." But after only a few bites, she set her fork down, her appetite lost.

When she tried to slip out of his office, he gently nudged her toward the lounge.

"Just rest a bit, okay?" With a wry smile, Felix joked, "I need you in one piece for the launch of our new product."

A soft laugh escaped Hannah."I'm tougher than I look."

Felix shook his head. "That's not true."

He still remembered that back when Hannah hadn't married and was still hidden behind the alias"Victoria,"she had fallen ill after facing online backlash for her initiatives as "Victoria." Her old college roommates had shared that detail with him during one of his visits to her campus.

Hearing the genuine concern in his voice, Hannah felt her cheeks warm with embarrassment. She didn't resist and straightforwardly said, "Alright. I'll rest for a while. Just wake me up when it's time to get back to work."

With a nod, Felix eased the door shut behind him.

At his desk, he found himself distracted by thoughts of her resting just a few steps away. Something about sharing this space with her felt different, more meaningful-maybe it because she held a special place in his heart.

Time slipped by. By the time the clock hit three, Felix still hadn't stirred Hannah from her nap. He secretly hoped she'd sleep even longer, knowing how much she needed some rest.

Out of nowhere, the receptionist rushed in. "Mr. Wade, someone from Polaris Tech wants to meet with you!"
Felix quickly put a finger to his lips. "Quiet, please." Leaning in, he whispered urgently, "Polaris Tech? Tell them I'm not available. I don't know who they are."

Just then, a voice spoke up from behind the receptionist. "You must be Mr. Wade."

Three visitors entered-two men flanking a poised woman.

Brinley, linking arms with Vincent, offered a bright smile. "We're here to discuss a potential partnership, Mr.Wade."

Clive stepped forward and extended the business proposal.

Felix, however, didn't reach for it, instead locking eyes with Vincent in silent acknowledgment.

Feeling the tension, Clive awkwardly withdrew the proposal.

A cool,assessing glance came from Vincent. "Your operation here is on the small side."

Unfazed, Felix responded evenly, "Naturally, our company can't compare to yours, Mr. Jones."

A flicker of surprise crossed Brinley's face-did these two know each other?
###Chapter 80 Sleep In Another Man's Office


Across the table, Brinley noticed the quiet standoff between the two men. Her urge to speak was strong, but she kept her questions to herself, wondering why Felix's face stirred up a sense of familiarity. Even so, none of that could distract her from what really mattered-the acquisition was the only thing on her mind.

Wasting no time, Brinley leaned forward. "Mr. Wade, reports have surfaced about your company heading for bankruptcy. That's why we're here to talk about acquiring it."

Taking charge, Vincent casually settled into the seat behind Felix's desk, giving off an air of authority."Name your price."

A small laugh escaped Felix. "Mr. Jones, Nova Tech isn't exactly a bargain."

Instead of responding, Vincent stretched out a hand. Clive, quick on the uptake, placed a folder in his palm.The proposal slid across the desk toward Felix as Vincent's tone cut through the room. "Our analysts have assessed your business. At best, it comes to five million."

With an extra dose of pride, Vincent added, "We're willing to pay five million to take Nova Tech off your hands." He fixed his eyes on Felix, clearly expecting the man to surrender.

Felix's answer was nothing but a cool grin. "Five million? Hard to pass up, I'll admit."

Seeing an opening, Brinley brightened. "Exactly, Mr. Wade. The money could be wired to you before the day ends. On top of that, I can assure you that every employee at Nova Tech would be welcomed at Polaris Tech, yourself included. We'd even love for you to join us as vice chairman."

Though Felix's expression never wavered, his voice grew firm. "It's a generous offer from both of you,but..."His eyes narrowed slightly. "I won't be selling Nova Tech. All debts are settled. There's no bankruptcy happening here."

Offering a cordial smile laced with subtle dismissal, Felix remarked, "Regardless, I do thank you for your concern."

That response sent Brinley reeling. Her subsequent moves hinged on acquiring Nova Tech. Doing her best to hide her disappointment, she composed herself and pressed on. "Is it a matter of numbers, Mr. Wade?Polaris Tech, with the full backing of the Jones Group, can easily increase the offer. Money isn't an obstacle
for us."

Vincent's eyes flickered as he glanced up at her briefly, though he stayed silent.

Meeting Vincent's look without wavering, Felix replied, "This isn't a question of finances. Nova Tech was founded through a partnership with someone I hold in the highest regard. Selling isn't an option. I'm not the person you should be negotiating with. I think it's time you left."

Refusing to concede defeat, Brinley made one last attempt. The stakes were too high for her to walk away now. "Mr. Wade, if there are any terms or requirements you'd like us to consider, just say the word.We're ready to accommodate you however we can." She positioned herself at the edge of the desk near Vincent,her tone unwavering and earnest.

But Felix remained unmoved. "I have to refuse. As I mentioned before, Nova Tech isn't up for sale."

Finally, Briney's professional facade slipped for a split second. She hadn't anticipated such stubborn resistance, and it dawned on her that a direct approach to the other partner might have been wiser. Despite her displeasure, she held her composure. "Nova Tech hasn't turned a profit in years. It's a struggle to keep the business afloat. Aligning with the Jones Group is your surest path to a stable future. Please reconsider,Mr.Wade."

Vincent rose from his seat with the commanding air, his expression cold and composed. "You have three days to think this through."

Without another word, he turned, heading to the door of the room.

But Brinley remained planted, unwilling to accept defeat so soon. With negotiations already underway,she sensed that a little extra push might tip the scales. After all, who would turn their back on that much money?Certainly not a business barely scraping together a million in annual revenue. It seemed impossible to her that Felix could turn his nose up at a five-million-dollar payout.

Felix, already losing patience, spoke up before she did."My answer stands. There's nothing more to reconsider."

Just then, a faint creak broke the tension-a sound coming from the lounge.

A door edged open. Hannah appeared in the doorway, her steps slow, eyes still foggy with sleep."Reconsider what?" Her question came out soft and unhurried, carrying the languor of someone who'd just left a sun-warmed bed.

Recognition flickered across Vincent's face at the sound of her voice. Instantly, he stopped in his tracks and pivoted. His wife was in another man's office. The haze of a recent nap still lingered around her.

A thundercloud passed over Vincent's features, his expression shifting in an instant.

###Chapter 81 My Woman


Spotting Vincent and Brinley just a few steps away, Hannah snapped to full alert. Any trace of drowsiness vanished, even though her brain was still catching up.

Clive's jaw threatened to drop in shock. His boss's kept woman was in another man's office? He couldn't wrap his head around it. So, Hannah hadn't been dumped yet?She must have more cunning than he'd given her credit for. Scorn twisted in his mind.

Even Brinley couldn't hide her astonishment at Hannah's appearance. In that instant, it dawned on her why Felix's face had seemed so familiar. Her memory brought back the image of him sitting with Hannah at Chance Cafe. Clearly, their connection ran deeper than she'd realized. But what was really going on between them?

Instinct drew Brinley's attention to Vincent. His face made everything clear-he was seething. His glare at Hannah could have frozen stone.

Brinley immediately understood. Vincent's ego was wounded.

No one dared to break the suffocating silence that filled the room.

With a relaxed smile, Felix closed the distance between him and Hannah."Did we wake you up? Why not sleep a bit longer?" he said softly.

Checking the time on her phone, Hannah realized it was almost four o'clock. "Why didn't you wake me?"

A gentle grin lingered on Felix's face. "I figured you deserved a little more sleep."

She regarded Vincent and Brinley with a cool stare and asked, "They're here for Nova Tech?"

Felix kept his gaze steady on her. "That's right. They're here hoping to buy the company."

Any warmth vanished from Hannah's features as the reality hit. So Vincent was aiming for Nova Tech now?

Tension sliced through Vincent's voice as he spoke, lips pressed into a thin line. "Come over here. Now."Every word landed like a slap of winter air.

Not a single step did Hannah take. She simply gave him a look.

A hard knot formed in Vincent's chest. Damn it. His mother had been right all along. Hannah had rushed out early this morning just to meet this guy. On top of everything, she'd actually sleep in this guy's office.

A bitter laugh burst from Vincent as he crossed the space between them in quick, forceful steps. His hand seized Hannah's wrist, attempting to yank her away.

"Let go of me!" Hannah exclaimed, twisting against him, but his grip refused to loosen. Angry red marks sprang up on her skin almost immediately.

Without missing a beat, Felix moved in, securing Hannah's other arm. His eyes narrowed with challenge."Mr. Jones, care to explain exactly what you're doing right now?"

Vincent's gaze grew icier as he let out a short, mocking laugh. "Why would I owe you any sort of explanation?"

Not backing down, Felix's tone grew firmer. "Dragging my woman out of here absolutely demands an explanation."

Hushed silence blanketed the office. All attention focused on Felix.

Brinley's eyes widened in shock. Felix had feelings for Hannah? If that was the case, their negotiation just got a whole lot trickier. No acquisition would go smoothly with feelings tangled up like this. There was no telling what influence Hannah might wield over Felix.

The way Felix immediately came to Hannah's defense filled Brinley with scorn. Hannah was really something else-after falling out with Vincent, she wasted no time jumping into another man's armns. Yet, did Felix understand he might be nothing more than Hannah's consolation prize?

Eyes slanting in calculation, Brinley spoke up, her voice smooth. "Vincent, don't be upset. I'm sure there's been some kind of misunderstanding."

Vincent ignored Brinley's words altogether. A frosty chuckle slipped from him as he tightened his jaw. "You said your woman?"

In a gentle but steady tone, Hannah addressed Felix, "Let go,please."

Hannah understood Felix's intention at once-he actually meant business partner, but to keep her role at Nova Tech under wraps and ease her out of the confrontation, he opted for the words "his woman" instead.She didn't doubt his intentions. His support meant a lot. Even so, she had no wish to drag him into the fallout between herself and Vincent.

After a moment's hesitation, Felix released Hannah's wrist.

Hannah's steady gaze met Vincent's thunderous glare. She had no intention of causing a scene here, so her words came gently. "If you want to talk, we can do it back at home."

An edge crept into Vincent's voice as he insisted, grip tightening. "Then come home with me now."

Hannah's voice was quiet, but her resolve didn't waver. "Vincent, my life is my own. I decide where I go. And right now, I have other priorities-I'm not leaving."

A dangerous light flickered in Vincent's eyes. "Priorities? Is that your way of saying you're off flirting with another man behind my back?"
###Chapter 82 Don't Force Her


Hannah was stunned. Vincent always knew how to break her heart. A handful of careless words from him had managed to sweep aside everything she'd put into the relationship, all those years of loyalty and honest effort. By now, though, her heart had grown numb enough not to let the pain sink in.

A slight smile touched Hannah's lips as she faced Vincent. "I guess I'm not as occupied as you are. You seem to need Miss Gilbert by your side at every turn."

Vincent's answer came in that calm, low voice of his. "Brinley and I are just working."

At Vincent's response, Brinley quickly chimed in, "Hannah, please don't read too much into it. I wanted to acquire Nova Tech since Polaris Tech really needs a solid force like Nova Tech. Vincent worried I might be in over my head, so he accompanied me to discuss the acquisition with Mr. Wade."

Brinley managed to praise Felix's company while also slipping in a little bragging for Hannah's ears. She aimed to make sure Hannah noticed just how much effort Vincent was willing to put in for her, even if it meant going out of his way to help with business.

There was no confusion on Hannah's part. She understood exactly what Brinley was getting at. It could not be clearer to her just how much Vincent valued Brinley, even if no one spelled it out. At this point, she didn't care anymore.

Hannah held her head high and said to Vincent, "Felix and I are just working."

She studied Vincent's face, noticing a quick flash of skepticism in his eyes.

"What sort of work keeps you by his side and even sleeps in his office?" Vincent's glare was sharp and full of fury, and every word seemed to dig painfully into Hannah's chest.

Every word from Vincent was meant to wound, belittling Hannah while slandering Felix.

The insult hit hard, filling Hannah with a sudden, sharp anger. She lifted her hand and landed a slap across Vincent's face.

A sharp crack echoed in the room, and everyone present froze in shock.

"Vincent, are you alright?" Brinley hurried over. Her tone was sharp as she yelled at Hannah, "That was too  much.How could you treat Vincent like that?"

Clive, standing nearby, began to show signs of nervousness. No one had ever laid a finger on Vincent before. There was no denying Hannah's boldness.

With a face set in stone, Hannah stared back and said, "Why shouldn't I slap him? He's the one who went too far. And what position do you have to lecture me?"

Brinley found herself at a loss for words, clearly wanting to keep Hannah's marital connection to Vincent under wraps, especially since Clive was around. Still, she tried to defend Vincent anyway. "It isn't right to hit someone. Look, his cheek is red."

Worried, she added, "Vincent, let go of her hand so I can see how bad it is."

Vincent refused to let go, his grip steady and unmoving. Anger tightened his jaw, and he kept his dark eyes locked on Hannah.

Felix moved to intervene, but Hannah raised her hand, stopping him in his tracks. A sharp laugh escaped her."So what? Miss Gilbert, aren't you here to look after him?"

For a moment, Brinley hesitated, hovering close to Vincent. "Vincent, you should put some ice on your face.Let's leave now."

Yet, Vincent paid her no heed, his focus on Hannah unbroken. "You're coming back with me. Right now."

He acted as if the slap hadn't happened, stubbornly insisting on taking Hannah back, gripping her wrist even tighter.

"I'm not going back with you now." Defiance shone in Hannah's eyes as she tried to wriggle free of his grasp. "Let go." She had long decided that her own feelings would come first.

Neither one seemed ready to back down.

Stepping in again, Felix addressed Vincent, "Mr. Jones, Hannah has made it clear that she isn't going anywhere with you. Please don't force her."

A cold laugh slipped from Vincent's lips. "You call this forcing her?" He let go of Hannah's wrist at last.

Hannah released a sigh of relief and rubbed her wrist, convinced Vincent had finally changed his mind and was about to leave with Brinley.
But the next second, Vincent unexpectedly scooped her up and threw her over his shoulder. The sharp edge of his collarbone pressed against her stomach while he carried her away as if she weighed nothing at all.
###Chapter 83 Carried Her Away


"Vincent, have you lost your mind? Put me down now!" Hannah flailed wildly, fists pounding against Vincent's back.

But to Vincent, the blows barely made a difference. "I won't."

Vincent's face was expressionless as he cast a cool glance at Felix and then carried Hannah out of the office and straight down the corridor, without letting go for a second, not even in the elevator.

Curious whispers started to fill the air as Nova Tech's employees tried to figure out what kind of chaos had just erupted in Felix's office. Their curiosity only grew when they spotted Felix marching after the duo.

All the way to the parking garage, Hannah kept struggling, and one of her heels slipped off along the way.When they reached the car, Vincent opened the passenger door with a single motion and shoved her into the seat.

Her knee hit the gearshift hard. Before she could even make sense of it, the central locking clicked into place.

She made a desperate grab for the window switch, but Vincent was faster. He caught her by the shoulders and pressed her back into the seat.

"Sit still." With his hand firm against her lower back, his gaze was sharp and unyielding.

Right then, Brinley and the rest of the group came downstairs and spotted Vincent bent over Hannah.From a distance, the scene looked too intimate.

Brinley managed a tight smile as she stepped forward. "Vincent, are we heading back now?"

He turned just enough and answered,"Yes."

"I'll ride with you then." Brinley moved to open the back door, but Vincent blocked her path. He lowered his voice and said, "Clive will drive you back to the office."

Still reeling from everything that had just happened, Clive quickly straightened up and replied, "Alright."

Brinley stood frozen in place,stunned.
Without sparing her another glance, Vincent walked around the car, climbed into the driver's seat, and pulled the door shut.

That was when Felix finally spotted Hannah in the passenger seat and started toward her, ready to check on her.Before he could even get close, Vincent pulled away and the car sped out of sight.

Felix remained rooted in place, his hands trembling just a little.

A wave of resentment toward Hannah flared in Brinley's chest as she pressed her lips together. Once again,Hannah had wrecked her plans. And Vincent-no matter how angry he might be-he should've prioritized her.

Trying to mask her irritation, Brinley turned to Felix. With a practiced motion, she held out a business card."If you ever change your mind, Mr. Wade, you can always get in touch with me."

Felix snapped back to reality and didn't take her business card. His voice was cool. "That won't be necessary."

Brinley awkwardly withdrew her hand, silently cursing how impossible it was to sway this man. His firm tone made it obvious that acquiring Nova Tech was off the table. She'd have to rethink her strategy.

After a moment's thought, she offered him a warning, her smile forced. "Mr. Wade, just be careful. Don't let Hannah pull the wool over your eyes."

Felix turned, and a sharp edge crept into his voice. "What are you trying to get at?"

Feigning concern, Brinley softened her voice. "Honestly, I'm just looking out for you. Hannah's been awfully close with Mr. Jones, and now she's tangled up with you. I'd just hate to see you used."

In Brinley's mind, it was clear. Hannah was hedging her bets, getting close to Felix even before her divorce was settled.Letting Hannah succeed wasn't an option.

Felix didn't react the way Brinley had expected. Instead, he gave a dry, almost amused laugh. "You're overthinking it." If only Hannah had hidden feelings for him, that would've been a good thing. But she didn't.Not even close.

Unwilling to let it go, Brinley added, "I simply don't want you to be fooled."

"Spare me your tricks," Felix said, his voice ice cold. "Jumping to conclusions about people you barely know only tells me what kind of person you are. I'm relieved I won't be doing business with someone like you."
Stunned, Brinley stood in silence, her nails digging sharply into her palms.

"Have a good day," Felix remarked, his voice dry and distant. He turned around and walked away, not sparing her so much as a backward glance.
###Chapter 84 A Surprise Proposal To Brinley


Clive quietly slipped away to arrange for a company car. When the vehicle arrived, Brinley climbed in, her mood sour and written all over her face.

Settling into the front seat, Clive couldn't help but notice Brinley's frustration, so he started thinking of ways to lift her spirits. He suddenly thought of the ring he had shown Vincent earlier in the day. He should have kept it a secret from Brinley, but today felt different, and he figured it might just cheer her up.

Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the small box with enthusiasm."Miss Gilbert, would you like to see something special?"

Ever since Brinley had taken over Polaris Tech, everyone at the Jones Group went out of their way to please her.

A touch of curiosity entered Brinley's voice. "What do you have there?"

She accepted the square box from Clive's hand, her fingers lingering on the lid. When she opened it, a set of matching rings greeted her eyes.

Delight sparked in Brinley's expression, and she gasped, "Are these... Did Vincent have these made?"

Clive nodded, eager to please. "Who else would have prepared them except Mr. Jones?"

"Oh my!" Brinley hadn't expected Vincent to have the rings ready so soon. She was truly surprised.

"Take a look up close, Miss Gilbert. The craftsmanship of the rings is remarkable."

Brinley lifted the woman's ring and studied it with bright, admiring eyes. She couldn't help but slip the ring onto her left hand. It slid on easily and looked absolutely stunning. Her excitement got the better of her, and she pulled out her phone to snap a few photos.

As Clive watched her admire the ring, a question popped into his head. The fit was so perfect on Brinley's finger. Why did Vincent insist on resizig it by just a single millimeter? He quickly shrugged it off, deciding Vincent must have his reasons.

A little nervously, Clive leaned in."Miss Gilbert, if Mr. Jones does propose, please pretend I never showed you the ring. If he hears I spoiled the surprise, he'll never forgive me."
A small smile tugged at Brinley's lips, and her eyes lit up with amusement as she took off the ring and handed the ring box back to him. "You don't have to worry. I'Il act like I never laid eyes on those rings."

She found herself already picturing the moment Vincent might get down on one knee and propose.

···

Vincent kept his foot heavy on the gas, racing back to the Jones family estate at speeds nearing 120kilometers per hour.

His phone rang partway through the drive, and Derek's voice came through the speaker. "Mr. Jones, I've managed to redecorate your room based on your sketch. Due to time constraints, the details leave room to improve."

"Alright," Vincent answered simply and hung up.

After that, the car fell silent again.

Hannah spent the entire trip staring out the window, refusing to look at Vincent or speak to him.

When they finally reached the house, Vincent didn't bother with small talk. He caught her wrist and dragged her straight upstairs.

"What do you think you're doing, Vincent?" Hannah tried to yank her hand free, but he didn't let go. Her bare feet barely kept upo as he yanked her into their bedroom on the second floor.

Vincent's hold was unyielding, and when he finally released her, she was thrown onto the bed.

"From now on, I want you to stay home and focus on planning Grandma's birthday celebration." His eyes stayed cold as he laid out his demands. "You're not to leave the house or spend time with anyone questionable, especially Felix."

A bitter laugh slipped from Hannah. "And why should I listen to you?" She got off the bed, her brow furrowed in anger. "You're out of line. Do you really think you can lock me up like a prisoner?"

Vincent swallowed, struggling to suppress his fury. "I am your husband."

She met his gaze, refusing to back down. "So what? Just because you're my husband doesn't mean you get to control my life."

Hannah stepped forward, jabbing her finger into his chest as she spoke with resolve."If I want to leave or see someone, that's for me to decide, not you." And it wouldn't be long before he was nothing more than her ex-husband.

Though her pokes were more defiant than forceful, Vincent's patience snapped, and on the third jab, he caught her wrist in his grip.

###Chapter 85 Is He Really That Great


Anger tightened every muscle in Vincent's jaw, his expression nearly black with frustration. "Now my grandmother's birthday means nothing to you? Only a week remains. She trusted you and handed over all the planning. But you just slipped out before sunrise to see another man."

A wave of numbness washed over Hannah. The way he kept repeating "another man"-as if thatwas the only story he could imagine-cut right through her. Not for a moment did he believe that she and Felix just had work to handle. In his world, she had no career, only the title of wife, forever playing house. That was the only version o her he could see. That was the only role he'd ever let her play.

A hollow ache settled deep in her chest. Eight years of her life, gone, wasted on this man. What did she even have to show for it? An illusion of "happiness." Even the love itself-fake. But there was one truth he hadn't exaggerated-seven days remained. Seven days left before the divorce papers would finally mean freedom.

A sharp,sarcastic laugh slipped from Hannah's lips. "You think my meeting Felix means I'm unfaithful? Then explain you and Brinley. Every single day, you find a reason to see her-how would you label that? Cheating on me?"

With a snap, Vincent tore off his tie, his voice rough with denial. "I've told you again and again-nothing is going on between me and Brinley!"

She didn't flinch. "Then it's not what you think between me and Felix either."

With that, Hannah wrenched her arm from his grasp and turned away, drawing a line he could not cross.

"Then why the hell did I find you woke up in his office? If I hadn't walked in, would you have gone home with him next?" Vincent questioned.

Anyone listening would have pegged Vincent's outburst as pure jealousy.

Hannah, however,recognized the truth. Jealousy had nothing to do with it. What fueled him now was pure fury. His ego had taken a direct hit. Keeping their marriage under wraps was one thing,but watching her share space with another man was something he couldn't tolerate.

No effort went into justifying herself. She didn't bother to console his wounded pride. "Believe whatever you want."

Without another glance, she pushed past him, making for the door.

In one swift motion, Vincent caught her by the wrist and tossed her back onto the mattress. "We're not done here.Where the fuck do you think you're going?"

A bitter laugh escaped Hannah as she glared at him. "So now I'm not even allowed to crash in the guest room?"

Rage flared in her cheeks. She tried to sit up, but Vincent swung a leg over her, trapping her in place.

Something unreadable flickered in his gaze, dark as midnight. "Is that what all this is about? Separate rooms, repeated talks of divorce-because of Felix?" His voice was taut, nearly trembling. "Is he really that great?"

Hannah's eyes flashed. "I told you, he's got nothing to do with it. Now get off me!"

Desperation took over as she bucked beneath him, her fists flying, but he easily trapped both wrists in his grasp.

With his features hidden in the half-light, Vincent hovered over her, unreadable. "Did you sleep with him?"

That single question turned Hannah to stone. So this was what he truly believed about her. A wave of tears threatened to spill, sharp and hot with shame, but she clamped down on them, refusing to give him that satisfaction. Long ago, she'd promised herself she would never again cry for Vincent.

"Bastard!" she spat out, her voice trembling with fury.

A jolt of clarity snapped through her as she drove her knee upward, fighting back with every ounce of strength.Both hands remained locked in his grip, or else she would have slapped him on the spot.

He drove her past the edge of reason. What on earth had drawn her to him in the first place? Had she really been so mesmerized by his handsomeness back then?

"Get off me.I said get-" The last word was swallowed as Vincent crushed his mouth against hers.

Every trace of tenderness was missing-his kiss crashed into her with raw, desperate hunger.

Refusing to yield, Hannah pressed her lips together, denying him entry.

A rough command escaped him."Let me in."

One hand snaked upward, gripping her jaw tightly. His thumb pressed harshly against her cheek, forcing her mouth apart.

"Mm-"

Without a pause, he plunged forward. His tongue invaded, grazing the roof of her mouth as his breath came hot and uneven against her face.
###Chapter 86 Angry Sex


Annoyance boiled inside Hannah, each second ramping up her frustration.

Her flailing legs knocked over the glass lamp by the bed. The sharp crash of shattering crystal sliced through the room, but Vincent didn't so much as flinch. He stayed locked to her mouth, unyielding.

Every second, the kiss intensified, raw and unrelenting. Jagged glass crackled underfoot, blending with the ragged, hungry sound of his breathing.

Losing patience, Hannah sank her teeth into his lower lip, hard enough to draw blood.

Vincent only grunted, tightening his hold as he pulled her closer, claiming her tongue with a fierce,possessive urgency that made her throat ache in resistance.

Several long moments passed before he finally broke away, shifting his weight off her and letting go of her wrists.

Roughly,Hannah wiped her mouth, her glare seething with disgust."Asshole!"

Vincent stared down at her, eyes dark, slowly unbuttoning his cuffs. He shrugged off his jacket, fingers moving to unbutton his shirt.

Alarm shot through Hannah. She scooted backward, her voice sharp."What are you doing?"

A cold, enigmatic smile flickered across his face."Thought I'd show you just how much of an asshole I can be."

He pinned her beneath him again. Fabric tore sharply as he ripped at the edge of her skirt, his movements rough and unforgiving. Instinct drove her to strike back, knee flying upward, but he intercepted her ankle mid-motion, dragging her beneath him once again.

Nails dug into his shoulder as she raked his skin, angry red lines blooming up his neck. "Vincent, don't even think about it-"

A dark, gutturaI reply met her words. "We're husband and wife, Hannah. Or has that slipped your mind?"

He kept her pinned beneath him, not backing off for an instant. "Besides, Grandma keeps asking when she'll have a great-grandchild. Figured today's as good a time as any to make that happen."

Those words hit her harder than any physical blow. The idea of a child-his careless mention-left her paralyzed, dredging up wounds she'd never healed. With quiet resistance, her palms pressed firmly into his chest, but she said nothing. Her head turned aside, her face void of expression.

A crease formed between Vincent's brows as he hesitated. "You're not willing?"

No answer left her lips.

That silence cut deeper than a shout. One strong hand snatched both her wrists, pinning them high above her head, closing any gap between them.

The sharp bite of his belt buckle pressed into her side, cold and unyielding.

His mouth found her collarbone, teeth scraping before he jerked the fabric apart-buttons skittered across the floor, the harsh snap echoing with her startled breath in the heavy hush.

No part of her was unfamiliar to him. As he glimpsed the flush rising to her ears, his breath grew ragged,heavier with each second.

Yet, his features stayed locked in place, unreadable, as his fingers worked the belt loose, raising what was left of her skirt and thrusting into her.

Through Hannah's blurred vision, she saw him looming over her, his shirt rumpled and half-untucked,the fabric clinging loosely to him, rising and falling with each restless breath.

Time after time, the cool cotton grazed her bare waist-a relentless mix of irritation and shivers.

Without uttering a word, she endured it all, teeth pressed hard into her lower lip.

A few rough grunts escaped Vincent, but from Hannah, not even a whimper broke the silence.

He kept at it, refusing to stop until darkness filled every corner of the room.

At last, when it ended, she sat up, reaching for her scattered clothes and slipping them back on, never once looking in his direction. Her voice sliced through the air, cold as steel. "You're terrible in bed. I didn't feel a damn thing. Maybe you should get some pointers from those male escorts-they actually know what they're doing."

No one could have missed the venom dripping from every syllable.
A scowl took over Vincent's face, and he twisted his lips into a sneer. "Look who's talking. You just lay there,stiff as a corpse. There was nothing to feel."

The second he finished, regret flickered across his face. His mouth opened, searching for an apology, but Hannah beat him to it. A harsh laugh broke from her. "Unbelievable. You feel nothing, but you still did it anyway. That must have been quite a sacrifice for you."

She spotted a pillow on the floor, snatched it up, and hurled it at him with a snap of her wrist.

It struck him squarely in the chest, and he stared back, features set in stone. "Yeah, sure. I'm the pathetic one. I'm the fool for wanting a family with you. Guess that's my mistake."

Blind anger had driven him-never the kind of impulse that guided the logical, measured Vincent Jones of old.

"Don't even mention children to me." Instantly, Hannah's features iced over. Her lips pressed into a thin line,breath coming sharper as her lashes quivered.

A chill flattened her words. "I will never have a child with you." That tiny, one-month-old heartbeat she had lost-nothing could ever heal that scar. With divorce drawing nearer every day, the thought of bringing a child into this mess was utterly unimaginable.

Hannah's rejection struck a nerve. Vincent let out a sharp, bitter breath of laughter. "If not me, then who,Hannah? Felix Wade?"
###Chapter 87 Redecorated For Her
Once again, the conversation circled back to Felix.


No energy remained in Hannah for explanations.Keeping her gaze on the floor, she retorted, "What if it is? Having a child with Felix is certainly better than with you. At least he's emotionally stable."


A cold shadow crossed Vincent's face. He parted his lips to speak, but nothing came out.


Hannah was fully aware her answer would cut deep.She didn't care. Vincent's mind had already made up its own story-he was sure she'd slept with Felix.Justifying herself felt pointless. The end of their marriage was near. He could believe whatever nonsense he wanted.


With her dress torn beyond repair, Hannah walked into the walk-in closet to hunt for anything remotely presentable. A random pair of pants was all she bothered to grab before slipping them on.
An uneasy silence stretched between them.


Emerging from the closet, she found Vincent perched on the edge of the bed, shirt half-unbuttoned, cigarette between his fingers, smoke curling upward in lazy spirals.


As soon as his eyes caught hers, he crushed the burning tip between his fingertips, snuffing it out.


Not a flicker of emotion crossed Hannah's face as she shot him a cool, indifferent look.


Without another word, she strode for the exit. Her hand barely brushed the doorknob before Vincent's voice stopped her. "Hannah."


Refusing to react, she pushed the door open.


Before she could leave, Vincent moved to block her path. "Didn't you see anything different about this room?" he asked.


Her response was flat. "I noticed. What of it?"


The change hadn't escaped her attention the moment she entered. Walls, furniture, every detail had returned to their original design-except for the missing crib in the corner. None of it meant.anything to her. For all she knew, Vincent could have done it to please Brinley. Perhaps Brinley's taste ran just as minimalist and elegant as her own. There was no way it was meant for her.



"Brinley must be on your mind a lot," Hannah remarked, delivering the observation with ease.


A frown creased Vincent's brow. "This has nothing to do with Brinley. I reset the room for you, and you're still not happy?"


A sharp, mocking laugh escaped Hannah. For her?Yeah,like she would believe.


With one firm motion, she tried to push Vincent aside. "Out of the way. I'm sleeping in the guest room."


A shadow fell over Vincent's expression. "I went out of my way to change this room's decoration back just because of your complaints, and yet you're not A pulsing vein stood out on his forehead. "Grandma's birthday is around the corner. Are you planning to stay angry with me until then? It's been days, and your outburst should have a limit."


An icy wave ran through Hannah. He had no real grasp of what this room represented in their lives. No -what it meant to her. In his mind, a little redecorating should magically erase all the damage.But some things can't be fixed by rolling back the clock. And worse, he always thought it was her problem. To him, she was just throwing a tantrum.


A biting, cold laugh slipped past Hannah's lips."Exactly! I just always throw a wobbly. If it's such a problem, then stop dragging it out-just divorce me.Brinley can move right into this newly decorated room. You can put that missing crib back in the corner, and the two of you can-"


"Hannah Scott!" Vincent interjected with a sharp,urgent shout.
She clenched her jaw. "What, did I strike a nerve?"


Once again, they'd reached a standoff.


Her hand shot out, aiming to get around him. But Vincent wouldn't let her pass. "I redecorated everything in here for you."


Hannah looked at him, her gaze steady and emotionless. "Maybe you did it for me, but where were you before any of this? Is patching things up after the damage was caused the only way you know? Some things, once they're broken, never go back to how they were-no matter what you fix. This room looks like before, but it doesn't feel like home.Some changes can't be reversed, Vincent, even if you try."



Much like her relationship with Vincent, once something was wrecked, it could never truly go back.


With barely any effort, Hannah brushed him aside."I'll take the guest room. This place doesn't feel like mine anymore."
Vincent watched Hannah's resolute silhouette,feeling the distance between them growing with every step she took. Defeat weighing him down, he wandered back inside the room and sparked a new cigarette.


Meanwhile, Hannah sat alone in the guest room,swallowing a contraceptive pill before pulling the covers over herself and willing her mind to shut off.
###Chapter 88 Scratched By A Cat
With Sharon's birthday drawing near, the Jones estate buzzed with constant movement and busy energy.


Hosts practiced their parts in one corner while decorators transformed every room in sight.


Most of Hannah's days remained devoted to her work at Nova Tech, but any spare time she found was spent overseeing the birthday banquet preparations back at the estate. Communication with Vincent had ceased entirely since that last confrontation.


Progress on Nova Tech's latest product couldn't have gone better-something that gave Hannah a rare sense of satisfaction in the middle of everything else.


If Sharon hadn't insisted on her company at nearly every evening meal, Hannah would gladly have buried herself in the office.

One day, catching Hannah just after a meeting, Felix suggested, "Let's grab lunch at the mall and go for a shopping session today."


A puzzled look crossed Hannah's face. "Why the sudden urge to shop?"


Felix's tone turned earnest. "You're the reason the hormone monitor bracelet project is moving SO quickly."


Hannah replied, never one to take all the credit,"Really, it's the result of the team's efforts."


Without the collective effort, she knew the project would never have come this far so fast.


Felix's smile returned. "Everyone on the team will see bonuses, and you deserve a reward too."


She shook her head, lips curving with gratitude."That's thoughtful, Felix, but it isn't necessary."


His determination didn't waver. "Well, I insist on rewarding you. Either join me today, or I'll be waiting at the mall until you do."
"Alright, alright, you win." A burst of laughter followed Hannah as she exited the room.


No sooner had the door clicked shut than Felix retrieved a small jewelry box hidden beneath his notebook.


Inside, nestled in velvet, lay a gold bracelet engraved with a delicate yellow rose-Hannah's favorite flower.


For days, he'd meant to present it to her under the excuse of appreciation for the project's success,yet nerves always held him back. Eventually, he settled on the mall outing as the perfect coverto finally give her the gift.



Jewelry box in hand, Felix made his way to the mall,rehearsing how he might deliver his surprise.



***



Meanwhile, Vincent's workload had reached a breaking point. At first, he'd imagined a month off would be enough to get close to Hannah again, but now he doubted even three months would suffice.

In the secretarial pool, stress was at a boiling point.Work meant for an entire quarter was now squeezed into a single frantic week.



On the other side of town, Brinley reeled from her recent loss at acquiring Nova Tech and set her sights on fresh opportunities.


One particular company-a leader in hit mobile games for women-caught her attention. Despite its runaway popularity, mismanagement and weak monetization had left the business teetering on bankruptcy.


Brinley saw enormous potential. She believed the key to any great product, especially those aimed at women, was understanding their desires-she got that right, and the market would always follow.


Vincent's relentless schedule meant he was not available when Brinley wanted him to join her for the acquisition, forcing her to manage negotiations alone. Now, all that stood between her and the deal was a signature on the final contract.
Their asking price was five million-a figure that immediately reminded her of Nova Tech's last negotiation.Confidence fueled her every step. She felt certain Vincent would greenlight the investment.


Brinley made her way to Vincent's office this morning, as informed by Clive.


One look at Vincent and her eyes caught the faint red marks across his neck, still visible even after a couple of days. She couldn't hold back any longer and asked about them. He brushed it off, claiming he was scratched by a cat.


Brinley wasn't convinced for a second. Given the cold tension she'd seen between Hannah and Vincent at the estate, she quickly pieced things together-those marks had Hannah written all over them. Clearly, a major fight had erupted between the couple, and the aftermath was pure silence.


Watching their relationship unravel brought a secret sense of satisfaction to Brinley-the more explosive their arguments, the closer they moved to divorce.

Standing by Vincent's desk, Brinley set the contract in front of him. "Vincent, I'm nearly finished with the acquisition talks. This is the draft for the game company-please review it."


He peered up at her, eyebrow raised. "So, Nova Tech's off your radar?"


A slight shrug accompanied her answer. "Chances of getting Nova Tech are slim to noné. After you left, I tried persuading Felix for quite a while. He's holding firm, so I turned my attention to another company that's got plenty of potential."


"Alright," Vincent murmured, already absorbed in the contract. For a while, Brinley lingered nearby,noticed his mug was empty, and without missing a beat,brewed him a new cup of coffee before quietly setting it at his side.


A small flicker of acknowledgement crossed Vincent's face as he watched her. "Brinley, you really don't have to do all this."


"That's just it, Vincent-I want to," she replied, her smile soft and unwavering.


Running errands for him, however minor, brought Brinley genuine contentment. This was the life she'd always imagined. If they married, she'd manage every detail of his world. Quiet optimism lingered in her heart, fueling her daily efforts.


She continued finding tasks to busy herself with, and after a while, Vincent stopped protesting and let her be.



Once her hands were idle, Brinley glanced at her phone and noticed the time had slipped right up to noon. "How about grabbing lunch together?" she suggested, hopeful.


Vincent didn't look up, his pen moving steadily over the page. "I'm not hungry," came his brief reply.


Before Brinley could coax him further, her phone buzzed with a new notification. A message had just landed in a high-profile group chat-a photo of Felix and Hannah together, instantly igniting rumors that Hannah had found a new benefactor after being dumped by Vincent.


Excitement flashed in Brinley's eyes as she picked up on the location of Felix and Hannah were seen. She turned toward Vincent with a meaningful look."Vincent, I was thinking about shopping for a present for Sharon's birthday. Would you go with me?"


A curt reply came from him. "I'm tied up today."


A hint of disappointment clouded Brinley's features."Alright, I'll let you work. I'll just pick something out on my own. Still, after what Sharon has said about me before, I'm afraid she won't like whatever l choose."



At that, Vincent checked his watch and clicked the cap onto his pen. "You have twenty minutes, that's all I can spare."

###Chapter 89 A Bracelet For Her

Silvercrest Mall was positioned just a short walk from the Nova Tech headquarters.



Felix took Hannah out there for lunch first, having reserved an upscale dining spot with a calm, elegant atmosphere-ideal for a quiet break together.


Though the setting invited ease, Hannah's mind stayed locked on the hormone-monitoring wristband.Their conversation hovered around the project.


After slicing his steak, Felix slid his plate across the table.



Hannah gently nudged it back. "I've got it. Thanks,though."


But he insisted, sliding it toward her once more."Come on. You're the brain behind this whole thing."


She gave a light smile. "You're overstating it just a little, don't you think?"


His tone shifted, serious now. "Not really. That wristband-it's genius. The product reminded me of the early days of Nova Tech-full of energy and life."


Back when the company was at its lowest-on the brink of bankruptcy-they'd pivoted toward male-centric products out of necessity, a strategy that led to repeated setbacks and lackluster outcomes.Thankfully, the tides had shifted. Nova Tech was once more headed in a favorable direction. Felix felt a flush of satisfaction.



Felix spoke. "Stop refusing the plate of steak, or l might start feeling hurt."


He winked playfully at her, making Hannah chuckle.


"Well,thank you then."



"Don't mention it."



The lightheartedness faded as Hannah steered the conversation back to work.

Felix quipped with a lopsided smile, "Don't tell me you're dreaming about the wristband project at night."


She tilted her head. "Nope. When I go to bed, I don't dream at all-I sleep straight through till morning."


Her daily schedule drained her completely-research by day, planning the birthday festivities by evening-leaving no space for restless thoughts.


No pointless worries. No constant tension. Just focus, direction, and a sense of control. That was Hannah's version of contentment.


Felix looked genuinely relieved for her, but after a moment, his brow furrowed with concern. He paused, voice low. "Last time, with Vincent...Everything okay?"


"Nothing worthy to fret over," she replied, a faint smile flickering, though not quite holding. "We're getting divorced. What's there to stress about?"


Their recent conflict had been explosive, and now they were in the middle of a sient war. Neither made a move to bridge the gap.


And for Hannah, that silence was bliss. No passive-aggressive stares. No pointless arguments. Just peace. That was all she needed.


"I'm really glad to hear that," Felix said softly. His eyes lowered. "So, when are you finalizing it?"


"Not long now. Just a few more days." Time kept pushing forward. Only five more remained until Vincent's grandmother's birthday.


At her answer, a subtle delight flickered in Felix's eyes.


The lunch ended on an easy note, and Hannah expressed her thanks more than once before they left the restaurant.


Afterward, Felix guided her toward a jewelry boutique.


Hannah glanced around, intrigued. "Picking something for someone? Your mom or your girlfriend?"


He didn't answer. Instead, he exchanged a brief look with the store clerk.


"Sir, this piece might interest you," the clerk offered.


Felix lifted a slender bracelet, holding it up for Hannah to see. "What do you think of this one?"


She studied it carefully. "The floral detail is really intricate. It's beautiful."


Felix's lips curved slightly. He shot a glance at the clerk, who caught on right away. "I'll help you try it on," the clerk offered, stepping in.


"Wait-I'm not-" Hannah instinctively pulled back,her eyes darting to Felix for help.


"Perfect," he said with a grin. "Try it on for me."


The clerk moved quickly. Before Hannah could protest again, bracelet was already clasped around her wrist.



Felix's eyes gleamed. "See? Fits you like it was made for you."


Hannah reached to undo the clasp, eager to return it -but just then, a scornful voice rang out across the room. "Look who it is. Mr. Jones's kept woman.What happened-did he throw you out already?"
###Chapter 90 Witty Comeback

Hannah turned with a cold stare as the voice cut through the air. A pack of well-dressed young men strolled over, each one flanked by a woman clinging to his arm.



Out in front walked Issac Stanley, a face Hannah instantly recognized.



Issac carried a reputation for arrogance and lack of manners, and it was he who had recently embarrassed Hannah in public.


Issac's gaze flicked to Felix as he taunted, "So,Hannah, this is your new benefactor? He doesn't seem impressive at all." He followed that up with a mocking laugh. "What's this about? After leaving Vincent, this is all you could snag?"


Laughter broke out among his friends, their amusement echoing behind him.

The insult stung, and Felix's brow furrowed as he moved forward, but Hannah quietly caught his arm to hold him back. She saw this as her own battle and didn't need Felix to fight for her. She could handle it.


Spreading rumors and gossiping behind people's backs had always been these people's favorite pastime, and she had heard much worse over the years. Now, such words didn't faze her in the slightest.


Standing her ground, Hannah locked eyes with Issac."Mr. Stanley, it's been some time. I heard your stepmother is about to bring a baby into this world soon.Congratulations on becoming a big brother!"


She knew exactly where to hit, thanks to Rena's tip.


Rena, fed up with how these spoiled heirs mistreated Hannah, had quietly given her the inside scoop.


Issac's biological mother had passed away early,leaving his father to remarry. Now, with a new sibling on the way and no position in the family business,Issac's pride was on shaky ground.
A scowl darkened Issac's features. "So you've been investigating around about me?" He stepped in closer, voice dripping with contempt. "I get it now.You're after me next, aren't you?"


To his mind, if she wanted him as a backer, she should have made her move instead of playing games.


Within their social circle, there were even bets on when Vincent would toss Hannah aside, and who would get to claim her next. It wasn't about love. It was all about her looks and the thrill of getting laid with her.Each man in the group eyed her with hungry interest, hoping to be the one to keep her around.


Hannah only responded with a cold smirk and an exasperated roll of her eyes.


Issac let his eyes wander over her, making no effort to hide it. He dropped his date's hand right away. "In that case, here's my offer. Serve me for a month, and I'll pay you this much." With a smug grin, he flashed a single finger, signaling the amount.
Hannah fixed him with a look of pure disdain. "Really,Mr. Stanley? Are you this stingy even when hiring a housekeeper?"


He bristled. "Who said anything about a housèkeeper? And you think a million isn't enough?"


A shrug was all she gave. "I don't think I have misunderstood anything. For Vincent, a million is spare change." Her hand shot up'to her lips as a thought seemed to dawn on her. "Oh, that's right.There's no way your family can measure up to the Jones family."


Issac's cheeks flamed with fury. "You-" He faltered,clenching his fists. "In the end, Vincent still dumped you. How could you still parade around with that attitude?"


"Guess I need to spell it out for you." Disdain laced her words as she met his gaze. "When you don't have the means, Mr. Stanley, don't entertain the idea of keeping a woman around. It's humiliating."


The gathered crowd erupted in laughter, unable to contain themselves.


Shame flooding his face, Issac lunged toward Hannah, intent on making her pay.


Felix was there in an instant, stepping between them,his eyes flashing a clear warning.


Hannah didn't hesitate to whip out her phone and snap a flurry of photos aimed at Issac and his crew.


A sly grin spread across her face as she stepped out from behind Felix, holding her phone high in the air."Mr. Stanley, if I were you, I'd gather up your friends and your date and leave right now. Otherwise, these photos are going straight to the internet. Imagine the scandal-keeping women on the side and stirring up drama in public. Your reputations won't recover.Think about your father, Mr. Stanley. If he catches wind of this, you'll only give him more reason to dote on your unborn brother instead."



Panic washed over Issac, draining the color from his face, and his companions hurried to drag him away before things got worse. They knew better than to take her threats lightly. One by one, they made their exit.



Felix watched Hannah with concern. This wasn't the first time she'd faced such insults and slander."Getting a divorce is for the best," he said, giving her a gentle look.
###Chapter 91 Use Me For A Fit Test





Hannah paused for a split second before catching on to the message behind Felix's words. A quick grin crossed her face as she beckoned to the store clerk,wanting to take off the bracelet.


A gentle interruption from Felix stopped the clerk from approaching. "Leave it on."


Confusion flickered across Hannah's face. "Shouldn't I take it off? I thought this was for someone else?"


With a shy rub at his neck, Felix admitted, "It is for someone. That someone is you."


The words caught Hannah off guard, making her freeze. "Wait, what?" Why would Felix suddenly be giving her a present?


Eager to clear things up, Felix continued, "Remember how I promised you a reward for your hard work?This is it."
A slightly embarrassed laugh slipped from Hannah."Oh...I misunderstood..."



Felix leaned in, curious. "Misunderstood how?"


Her gaze dropped to the bracelet as she fiddled with it. "I assumed lunch was my reward. But honestly,this bracelet is gorgeous.I really love it."


Felix masked his disappointment, a gentle smile returning. "I'm glad you like it."


He exchanged a glance with the clerk, mimed a payment gesture, and then led Hannah out of the shop, the bracelet still shining on her wrist.


Plans to return to the office faded when Hannah came to an abrupt stop in front of a men's suit boutique on the third floor.


Felix gave her a curious glance. "Something catch your eye?"


"I want to take a look at some suits," Hannah replied,already making her way inside. Felix kept pace, right on her heels.

"What's with the sudden interest in men's suits?" His tone was light.


A sheepish smile crept across Hannah's face. "You remember Miles Whitaker? He lent me his jacket once, and I ended up losingit. I need to find a replacement to return."


Every detail of the original suit-pattern, fabric,cut-remained vivid in her memory as she sifted through the display options.


"Got it." Felix gave a simple nod, offering quiet company as she searched.


"The only issue," Hannah continued, "is I'm not sure of Miles's exact measurements. You two are built pretty similarly, though. Mind being my stand-in for sizing?"


She gave him a quick, appraising once-over.


A grin spread across Felix's face. "I'm all yours-use me for a fit test."
Meanwhile, Brinley had taken Vincent all the way to Silvercrest Mall, the drive alone costing ten minutes.


A glance at his watch, and Vincent's frown deepened. "There's a luxury mall right next to the Jones Group building. What's the point of coming all the way out here?"


Brinley flashed a bright smile. "This mall is brand new, Vincent. They might carry something really exclusive. Just give it a look with me, please?"


"Ten minutes. That's all," Vincent warned, making no effort to hide his impatience.


"Absolutely," she replied, though she had no intention of sticking to his time limit. The moment he caught sight of Hannah shopping around with Felix,she doubted he'd care about how long they stayed.


Since Hannah refused to keep her distance from Felix, Brinley figured she couldn't be blamed. She was merely giving things a little extra push.


Brinley's hands drifted from display to display,but her thoughts never lingered on the merchandise.Every few seconds, her eyes darted to the entrances of each store,searching for Hannah and Felix.


Vincent trailed Brinley from shop to shop, all the way up to the third floor, still empty-handed.


Another look at his watch, and his patience snapped -ten minutes had come and gone. He'd had enough."Brinley, take all the time you want picking something out. I have to get back to work."


Brinley darted into Vincent's path, blocking his exit."Please don't leave yet, Vincent. You're already here.Just help me pick out a gift. I really want your grandmother to like me."


Her tone sounded earnest, but her gaze slid right past him. She was far more interested in the faces drifting by, intent on spotting Hannah and Felix in the crowd. This was the mall mentioned in the group chat, yet she hadn't caught even a glimpse of them.Maybe they'd missed their window-or perhaps the two had already slipped away.
Vincent's irritation was building, and he was on the verge of brushing past her when Brinley let out a sudden, dramatic gasp. "Look over there-aren't those Hannah and Mr. Wade? What are they doing together at this mall?"
###Chapter 92 Buying Clothes For Another Man
Vincent pivoted, his gaze sharpening as he caught sight of Hannah through the glossy storefront. She stood inches from Felix, fingertips smoothing the lapel of his suit with practiced care, their proximity laced with a warmth that could only belong to lovers.


A shadow crossed Vincent's face. He pushed open the glass door and strode toward the store, radiating a quiet intensity.


Brinley noticed the shift and, with a knowing smirk,slipped in right after him.


Meanwhile, inside the store, Hannah insisted that the clerk fetch every possible shade of deep indigo suit in Felix's size as she tried to purchase one similar to that lent by Miles.


When Felix finally emerged from the fitting room, his tie hung askew, and Hannah immediately rose on tiptoe, fingers deft as she adjusted the knot against his.chest.


Felix froze under her touch, breath hitching,awkwardness etched into every line of his body.


"This one's too loose," Hannah remarked, appraising the suit with a critical eye. The cut reminded her of the suit Miles had lent her, though this one, she thought wryly, couldn't compete in either craftsmanship or sentiment.


As she mulled it over, the piercing chime of the door shattered her thoughts. A man swept inside,his presence electric with anger.


Hannah picked up a smaller suit, ready to hand it to Felix to try on, but a hand seized her and pulled her roughly against a broad, unyielding chest.


The scent-unmistakable. She jerked her head up,her breath catching. Vincent? A second later, she noticed Brinley following close behind and pieced it together instantly-Vincent had brought Brinley along for shopping.


Hannah tore herself free, putting several feet between her and Vincent.



Vincent stood rooted to the spot, his gaze sharp as a blade, brimming with hurt and rage. His jaw tightened, voice cutting and cold. "So you're out buying clothes for another man, Hannah? Do I mean nothing to you now?"


Each breath he took was heavy, chest heaving as anger twisted across his features.


Felix interjected with a steady, measured tone, "Mr.Jones, maybe we should hear everyone out before making any accusations."


"Shut up!" Vincent shot back, not sparing him a glance. His attention was locked on Hannah, gaze unyielding."Explain."


A humorless smirk curled at the edge of Hannah's lips. "You saw everything. What more do you need to hear?" Brinley glided forward, her voice soft and soothing,stepping neatly into the tension. "Vincent, please,don't work yourself up. It could all be a misunderstanding. Hannah, just tell him what really happened-don't be so quick to shut him out."


Once again, Brinley seized the chance to project herself as gentle and understanding while subtly undermining Hannah.


Hannah's laughter was low and sharp. "You really do love playing the reasonable voice, don't you? But whatever's going on here is between me and Vincent. You really don't get a say in it since you're just a shameless homewrecker."


Though Hannah didn't raise her voice, every word cut through the air, drawing stares from a cluster of nearby shoppers.


Brinley flinched under the judgmental gazes,tears threatening to spill as she instinctively sought out Vincent for help.


Vincent's eyes went cold. He fixed Hannah with a look that could freeze fire, jaw clenched tight."That's enough, Hannah. Don't test me."


Hannah barely flinched. She'd long since grown numb to Vincent's instinctive move of shielding Brinley, no matter the circumstance. Stone-faced,her voice edged with frost, she said, "This is how l talk. Don't like it? There's the door. Kindly leave us alone. We have things to do."


A hollow sound escaped Vincent, something closer to a bark than a laugh. "Last time you were busy napping in his office. Now you're handpicking suits.What's next, a cozy family dinner at his place?" He felt she was deliberately getting under his skin.


His words drew even more attention from bystanders in the store.


Felix's expression tightened in disapproval, while Brinley-back turned to the crowd-couldn't suppress a tiny, smug curve of her lips.


Hannah caught Vincent's glare, his voice sharp with accusation. For a fleeting second, she saw a reflection of the hysterical version of herself from the past. The difference was-hers came from love. His outburst, though, reeked of nothing but wounded ego. But it didn't matter anymore.


Hannah fixed Vincent with a frosty, unflinching stare,refusing to waste even a single word in reply.


The moment broke as the sales assistant returned,arms full of suits arranged with meticulous care. "Ms.Scott, I've brought the rest of the indigo options for your boyfriend to try on."
###Chapter 93 Who Am I To You

 No explanation left Hannah's lips-just a soft "thank you."


As Hannah reached out for the suit from the sales assistant, Felix quietly stepped in to take it for her.Not once did he bother to set the record straight about being her boyfriend.


A brief glance passed between them, their understanding wordless and effortless.


Brinley's eyes darted from Hannah and Felix to Vincent,noting the storm gathering on his face.


Vincent's jaw clenched, and his gaze grew sharp and frigid, his attention locked on Hannah. "Wow.Upgraded to acknowledge him as your boyfriend already?"


Vincent was really livid. Only days ago, they'd been fighting, yet Hannah had already paraded around with the statement that she was with someone else.He saw through it-she wanted a reaction from him,and she knew exactly how to get under his skin. Felix was just the pawn for her little performance. Still,their closeness made a muscle jump at his temple.


Hannah's reply was calm, her tone cold. "Don't you already have chosen another woman to remarry Soon?"



She couldn't fathom his audacity in throwing accusations her way. Wedding dresses, renovations,this little shopping excursion-did he just make preparations for his big day with Brinley this time?Not that it mattered to her anymore.


Hannah's gaze flicked briefly to Brinley before she turned back to Vincent, her voice cool and dismissive. "If you're both finished, please move.We're busy here."


With that, her focus went back to the suits, while Felix continued watching her intently.


A humorless laugh escaped Vincent. Was she really telling him he was in her way? Unbelievable. A single step brought him closer as he reached out, aiming to seize HHannah's wrist. "You're coming with me."


With reflexes sharpened by experience, Hannah slipped neatly behind Felix, dodging Vincent's grasp before he could touch her. Vincent's hand met nothing but empty air.


Her instinctive retreat deepened the shadows on Vincent's face. "Come here," he said, his words taut and icy enough to send a chill through the store.


Hannah didn't flinch. "I'm staying right where | am.This time, you don't get to force me."


She refused to let herself be humiliated again. That ###Chapter was closed. Her eyes locked with his, steady and fearless.


Vincent stood motionless, the word "force" ringing in his ears like a blow. Instantly, he was dragged back to memories of that day in the bedroom. Apparently,that was how she saw him now. A man who relied on force. For a moment, anger, remorse, and confusion 
warred in his gaze. His throat worked, but no words came out.


Brinley, quietly triumphant, decided she'd seen enough. There was no point hanging around for another endless fight. She gently patted Vincent on the shoulder. "Vincent, let's go. It's obvious Hannah has more important things to do."


Another glance and Vincent caught sight of Hannah and Felix, standing so close together, laughter and gentle exchange passing between them. A storm brewed in his eyes as he shot them a glare sharp enough to cut glass.


Vincent's phone broke the tension-a call from Clive,who hurriedly informed him about a sudden international meeting. Ending the call, Vincent's eyes returned to Hannah, still dark and unreadable.


Vincent paused, voice cold and unforgiving, before turning to leave. "If you still care about my grandmother,remember your place."


Not so much as a blink came from Hannah. "And what place is that, exactly?" she asked, meeting his gaze head-on.


Vincent said nothing.


She pushed further, her lips twisting with a bitter edge."What exactly do I need to be mindful of? Who am I to you,really?"


Her lips twitched. She was just someone he kept in the shadows-never good enough to claim,always expected to act "properly" while he paraded Brinley for everyone to see. Now, he wanted her to stay in line when all she did was hang out with a business partner? How absurd.


No response came from him, nor did she expect one.Disappointment was a feeling she'd long since abandoned. It was the same pattern, always-if Vincent didn't want to answer, silence would settle in like fog.


Felix, off to the side, watched Hannah with steady,quiet sympathy, his heart twisting at the pain he saw in her eyes.

Not a single word left Vincent's lips. In silence, he turned away, Brinley falling in step beside him.


It was exactly as Hannah had expected. He always left without a word to the key question. He always had. Nothing about him had ever really changed.But she had-she no longer wasted her breath on questions that would only hang in the air unanswered. Gone were the days of chasing him,who would never turn back for her. Her priorities had shifted. From here on out, she'd start living for herself.


Letting those thoughts drift away, Hannah picked up the suit and handed it to Felix.


Without a word, Felix disappeared into the fitting room, emerging every so often until she found a jacket that fit him just right.


Hannah presented the chosen suit to the sales assistant. "We'll take this one. Please have it wrapped up."


"Right away."

Felix pulled out his wallet, ready to pay.


Hannah gently stopped him, firm but kind. "Don't even start-today's expenses are already on you. Let me handle this."


He just gave a little shrug, a gentle smile lightig up his face. "Alright."


On their way back to the office, Felix kept sneaking glances her way, clearly deep in thought.


She caught on and slowed her steps, turning to meet his gaze. "What is it? Do I have something on my face?"



He closed the distance, eyes searching hers for answers he couldn't quite put aside. At last, he gave voice to the question that had haunted him. "May I ask... Why did you ever marry Vincent?"


Felix had always wondered. From the outside, it had always seemed like Vincent didn't even like Hannah.How had she ever said yes to a man who offered so little in return?
A quiet, rueful smile curved Hannah's lips. "It's been five years," she said in a low voice. "I honestly think I've forgotten."

###Chapter 94 Vincent's Taste ls Appalling
The past was the past. Hannah had no desire to revisit it-her focus stayed ahead. Her pursuit of Vincent had been driven by his good looks, and their ending marked by a broken vow. How disgraceful.


Hannah's voice carried casual ease, but Felix's eyes betrayed a trace of pity.


Soon after, Hannah and Felix returned to their workplace.


Once seated, Hannah placed the bag containing the suit by her chair when her phone buzzed with a new alert.


Brinley had sent yet another image. It showed a close-up of her left ring finger, adorned with a new band."Vincent picked out our ring. Isn't it lovely?"


Hannah released a hollow chuckle. No wonder she had bumped into Vincent and Brinley earlier-he'd been out choosing wedding rings with Brinley. The wedding gown, the bedding, and now the ring. They were ticking off every ceremony milestone.


Hannàh tapped open the chat with Brinley and wrote."Hideous thing. Vincent's taste is appalling."


Then, Hannah blocked Brinley. She wouldn't allow anyone to ruin her day anymore.






Vincent headed back to his office, while Brinley returned to the Jones estate.


Upon seeing Hannah's reply, Brinley attempted to respond with, "Already upset, huh?" But the message wouldn't go through. She'd been blocked.


Burning with anger, Brinley muttered a curse beneath her breath.


As soon as Danica learned of Brinley's return, she emerged from her room with a warm welcome."Brinley, want something to eat?"

"I'm good, Mrs. Jones." Brinley linked her arm with Danica's and guided Danica to the sofa. Grinning slyly, she leaned in and murmured, "Guess who Vincent and I ran into today."


"Who?"



"Hannah," Brinley drawled lazily.


Danica's face immediately twisted with disdain."Did she try to stir up trouble again? Gee! That woman pops up everywhere. Always going on about how she's done with Vincent, but clearly she still cares-probably following you two around."


Brinley wasn't done. "Actually, she wasn't alone. A man was by her side."


"What?" Danica's brows shot up. "She's seeing someone already? How dare she cheat on my son!"Her voice rose with outrage. "No wonder she's signed those divorce documents so quickly. She already had someone else lined up! Did Vincent see her with another man?"

Brinley gave a confirming nod. "He did. For the second time."


Danica's voice turned razor-sharp. "That tramp! Not even legally single, and already hanging on another man? Utterly disgraceful. Thank heavens Vincent is walking away from her."


Danica rose in a rush. "I'm going to confront her myself."


Brinley stepped in. "Hold on-don't go storming off just yet. We need something solid. If you charge in now, she'll just deny it."


"What's the plan, then?"


Brinley stroked her jaw thoughtfully as she laid it out."We stay quiet for now. We can't alert her. And Sharon must not hear a word. Let's gather proof before we expose everything."


Danica inhaled sharply, working to smother her rage."Alright. We'll do this your way."
Meanwhile, at the Jones Group headquarters, Derek walked into Vincent's office with an update in hand."Mr. Jones, regarding the redecoration of your room,some furniture is on the way-you still want me to arrange it according to the draft you provided?"


"No longer necessary," Vincent answered coolly,eyes glued to the document in front of him.


"Understood. I'll cancel the orders. Though the crib's a problem. That supplier doesn't accept returns,"Derek muttered as he neared the door, only to be halted. "Hold on."



Derek quickly turned back. "Yes? Anything else?"


"Keep the crib."


"Alright. Where should I place it?"


Vincent gave him a frosty look."My home has plenty of rooms. Can't you just pick one to place it?"


"Got it." Derek nodded in compliance, completely in the dark about the meaning behind the change.

Vincent's abrupt shift in demeanor sent a cold ripple through the secretarial department. No one dared breathe too loudly.


Vincent stared at the contract lying before him. It was his third read-and not a word had registered.With a grunt, he grabbed his phone. No messages from Hannah. As expected.


Then, he noticed the buzz in the elite social group chat. Curious, he clicked inside. The topic of the day? Hannah.


Vincent's glare darkened with each message. Crude remarks, vulgar flirts, and lustful words-aimed squarely at Hannah.


He swiped past the filth, fists clenching-until a single image froze him solid. In it, a sales assistant fastened a bracelet on Hannah's wrist. Standing beside Hannah was Felix, his gaze on her, all gentle and tender.


Vincent's face clouded over. So that was why Hannah brought a suit for Felix. Felix had gifted her first. They looked every bit like a couple in a loving relationship.


Vincent's laugh was sharp, jagged, and bitter. His eyes were ablaze with silent fury.
###Chapter 95 Waited For Her Return At Home
Messages flooded the group chat, each more inflammatory than the last.


Vincent scrolled through them, his face unreadable but for the sharp line of his jaw and a muscle ticking in his cheek. Without a word, he summoned the legal team and thrust his phone at the nearest attorney.


The company attorney accepted it with clammy hands, nerves spiking-why would the CEO hand over his phone?


Vincent's voice cut through the tension, cold and absolute. "File lawsuits against everyone in that group chat for spreading rumors."


The attorney tensed, curious what messages in a group chat could rattle the CEO so badly. Leaning in,he scanned the group members and immediately felt  cold sweat trickle down his spine. Those weren't nobodies but heirs to Dorbarrow's most powerful families.


The attorney cleared his throat, voice wavering."Mr.Jones,are you absolutely certain?"


Vincent slammed his pen onto the contract, leaned back in his leather chair, and shot the attorney a razor-sharp look. "Yeah. Is that going to be an issue?"



A glacial look swept across Vincent's face, slicing through the air like a blade.


A bead of cold sweat rolled down the attorney's temple. "Not at all.I am on it."


Vincent offered no further instructions, so the attorney quickly made his exit, moving with the caution of someone tiptoeing past a sleeping predator.


All afternoon, Vincent remained in a foul mood.Anyone unlucky enough to enter his office found themselves on the receiving end of his wrath.


By four, he'd had enough. Lingering in the office wouldn't change much since his mind always wandered to Hannah, his efficiency affected. Leaving work early, he drove straight home-only to find no sign of Hannah.


He loosened his subtly patterned tie, barely masking his irritation, and called out to the housekeeper,"Where is my wife?"


"She still hasn't returned," Aubrey replied, her voice careful.


His expression darkened further, the tension in the foyer ratcheting up another notch.


She hurried to add, "Your mother set off shopping with Miss Gilbert and ought to be home shortly.Meanwhile, your grandmother went out to play chess with a few friends."


Vincent's gaze stayed heavy. "Alright."


"If that's everything, I'll go back to work," she said slipping away as quietly as possible.


Aubrey had barely taken a step before Vincent's voice cut through the quiet once more. "Has my wife been returning home late recently?"


He drifted toward the sofa, dropped into its cushions,and started undoing his cuffs, each motion deliberate, his features set in a frosty mask.


Aubrey hesitated and then answered honestly, "Yes.But only a little earlier than you each time."


The temperature in the air seemed to plummet.Vincent's glare sharpened, and a chill settled over the whole place.


Trying to ease the tension, Aubrey brought over a glass of juice, placing it within easy reach.


Vincent ignored it, perching on the living room sofa as he stared at the door.



Brinley and Danica were the first to return.


Brinley, spotting Vincent home early for once,

  brightened instantly and slipped onto the sofa beside him, launching into breezy small talk.


By seven o'clock, as dinner beckoned, Sharon strolled back through the door.


Vincent claimed his lack of appetite and skipped the meal, crossing his arms on the sofa and keeping his gaze on the doorway.


By eight o'clock, Danica wNas deep in conversation with Brinley, while Vincent remained anchored to the same spot, eyes unwavering, waiting for Hannah.


When Sharon had gone to bed at nine, Brinley lingered, offering to keep Vincent company. But he waved her off with a sharp, impatient gesture,sending her upstairs.



It was five past ten when the door finally opened and Hannah stepped inside.


Vincent had been waiting on the living room sofa all this time, a storm brewing in his eyes as she finally came back. "Do you even know what time it is? You still remember this is your home?"


Hannah's mind had spun with details about Nova Tech's product line, so absorbed that she didn't register Vincent's presence in the living room.The unexpected sound of his voice jolted her out of her thoughts.


And honestly, she couldn't fathom what right he had to question her like this. It was just ten o'clock-what was the big deal? And she'd already let Sharon know she'd be back. And hadn't he himself stayed out all night before?


Her irritation flared. "It's just after ten. Don't act like I've been out all night. And since when do you clock my curfew?"


His scowl deepened, a muscle ticking in his jaw.


Refusing to indulge him, Hannah turned toward the stairs, but Vincent moved first, planting himself in front of her, blocking her path with silent, simmering anger.

A brittle sigh escaped her lips as her irritation edged into her voice. "Now what do,you want from me?"


He leaned in, eyes narrowing. "So you've been with Felix all this time?"


Truthfully, she had. The hormone-monitoring wristband design was at a critical phase-there couldn't be any room for error.


Meeting his glare head-on, Hannah didn't even blink."Yes. I was with him the whole time. Satisfied?"


Vincent's face clouded over, his jaw flexing as he tried to hold back something sharper. "Is this all just to rile me up?"


She frowned, completely thrown. "What are you even talking about?"


His frustration boiled over. "First, you accepted the bracelet he picked out for you. Then, you go out and buy him a suit. What's next, candlelit dinners? Aren't you just deliberately trying to make me jealous?Maybe try acting your age." He grabbed her wrist with a sudden, angry movement, turning it until the bracelet flashed in the light. "Do you have any idea what people are saying? The rumor mill thinks you've bagged yourself a new benefactor."
###Chapter 96 Jewelry

Vincent's tone dipped so low that it sent an icy tremor racing along Hannah's spine. So he had been aware of how people badmouthed and slandered her the whole time, accusing her of being a kept woman while she was his rightful wife, their marriage under wraps due to his demands. He'd known what she had been through but chosen to do nothing.


Until now, she had been convincing herself he was oblivious to the helI she'd faced, and that if he had heard, he would've stood up for her. How pathetic.


Hannah wrenched her hand free from Vincent's grasp, her stare frigid as it locked onto his. "When they accused me of clinging to you like some pathetic leech, calling you my benefactor, you stood by and said nothing, still keeping our marriage under your hat. But the moment Felix and I were seen in the same store and rumors flared up, your ego was bruised, and their opinions suddenly mattered?

You're unbelievable, Vincent."


Vincent's mouth tensed. "We're talking about Felix.Leave everything else out of it."


Hannah scoffed. It always came down to whatever he decided was worth mentioning. She spun around to ascend the stairs, her voice drained of emotion."Then we've got nothing to address."


He moved again, palms planted firmly on the polished handrail, cutting off her path. "You won't talk? Fine." He seized her wrist and pinned it to the wall, his thumb pressing against the links of the bracelet."Then remove this."



Hannah tried to jerk her hand away, her voice laced with fire. "Who gave you the authority to decide what I keep?"


As she struggled, the chain dug sharply into her skin,leaving a scrape behind. "You're hurting me."


Without hesitation, Vincent tore the clasp and hurled the bracelet to the floor. "There. Not anymore."
Hannah's breath caught. She bolted down the stairs and snatched the bracelet up like it was something saored-but it was already broken.


Vincent's brow furrowed at how flustered she looked.She was this emotional-over a gift from someone else?



"Have you lost your mind?" she hissed, her glare freezing. The rage had peaked. She'd barely worn the bracelet for a full day-just enough to start getting used to it.


"It's just a bracelet," he shot back, his voice frigid."Have I ever failed to afford you any jewelry?" His voice was taut with rage. "You're seriously throwing a fit over something that didn't even cost ten grand?"


Hannah said nothing, her icy gaze fixed on him.


Vincent let out a sigh. "Fine. Derek will deliver a whole collection tomorrow. Choose whatever to your liking."


His tone was indifferent, even condescending-like 
the bracelet he broke was worthless. Like what she felt meant nothing. It made her blood simmer. To him,everything had a price tag. Even she did.


Hannah tightened her fingers around the broken bracelet, her voice hollow. "Save it. I'm not accepting anything from you."


Vincent gave a dry chuckle. "Is that so? Funny. You used to flaunt every item I got you like they were royal heirlooms."


She barely reacted-because it wasn't a lie. Back when she loved him, every gift had meant everything.But after he broke her heart, she'd sold them all.Every last piece. Including the purple gemstone necklace identical to the one Brinley wore.


Hannah gave a faint smile. "Then your observation is lacking. I haven't worn anything from you for ages."


Vincent faltered, his gaze instinctively dropping to scan her outfit.



Hannah ignored him and grabbed her belongings,continuing up the steps. "If you're hellbent on compensating me for the broken bracelet, get the exact same one. Anything else, I couldn't care less about."


She brushed past and headed straight to the guest room.


Vincent's throat bobbed, his reply stuck as he watched her walk away. His chest rose and fell sharply, his breath uneven. She cared that much about a bracelet Felix gave her-enough to demand an identical replacement?


A cold snort left his nose. She'd really learned how to get under his skin. He stood motionless, lips flattened, thinking. Then, he went upstairs.


As soon as Vincent entered their bedroom, he began rifling through the drawers. He didn't buy her claim.Even if she hadn't worn the jewelry he gave her lately, she must've brought those pieces here.She had once treated them like treasure.


But no matter how much he searched, there was hardly a hint of her presence left in this room. Except for a few garments in the wardrobe, none of it belonged to her now. Especially not any jewelry.


His expression hardened.Hannah had drawn the line clearly. Once declaring she wouldn't live in this room anymore, she'd have removed almost every trace of herself.


Since there was no jewelry here, she must've taken those pieces to the guest room. He crossed the hallway in swift strides and flung open the guest door without bothering to knock. It wasn't locked.


Hannah wasn't in sight. The water running in the bathroom made it clear-she was showering.


Vincent glanced around. The setup looked temporary, like someone who had no intention of staying long.


He had meant to inspect the drawers, but something on the desk caught his attention-a large branded bag. He lifted it and peeked inside. A neatly folded indigo suit jacket lay within, complete with cufflinks and a matching tie.


In that instant, every trace of anger faded away. His eyes lit up, and a grin tugged at his lips. So, the suit wasn't for Felix. It had been meant for him.
###Chapter 97 Skiing
Guilt twisted in Vincent's chest, quick and sharp. An idea surfaced almost instantly. He thumbed out a message to Derek. "Book two ski passes for tomorrow. And line up a sports car-a nice one,something a woman would love."


Vincent had noted that Hannah had been driving that car for almost five years. It was crying out for an upgrade. A memory surfaced of his skipping dinner with her parents for Brinley-and he knew he still owed her for that. He didn't think much of it. He would just make it up to her all at once.


Across town, Derek was sprawled in bed, half-focused on a mobile game, when Vincent's message popped up. He sat bolt upright. He typed back immediately. "Understood."


Rolling out of bed, Derek got to work, shaking his head with a crooked smile. Who was Vincent trying to impress this time?


Without missing a beat, he told Clive to push back every meeting set for the next day, freeing Vincent's calendar. Clive responded just as quickly.


Meanwhile, Vincent found his gaze lingering over the suit jacket, appreciation deepening as he traced the fine stitching. Hannah truly had an eye for style.


He was still lost in admiration when the bathroom door swung open without warning. He quickly set the jacket back in its place.


Hannah emerged, wrapped in nothing but a towel.At the sight of Vincent standing in her room, her expression tightened. "Why are you in here?" She tugged on a loose T-shirt, deliberately turning her back as she pulled it over her head.


Vincent closed the distance between them, his voice soft. "Do you have anything planned for tonight?"


He reached out, attempting to tuck a damp strand of hair behind her ear.

She immediately batted his hand away. "If you have nothing better to do, get out."


His hand dropped to his side, awkward and uncertain. She was still angry-understandably so.After all, she'd made the effort to pick out a gift for him, only for him to jump to conclusions and accuse her of things she hadn't done. Anyone in her position would be furious. Especially since she'd cared about him more than anything.


Trying to ease the tension, Vincent said, his voice gentler now, "I had Derek get us two ski tickets for tomorrow. You're available tomorrow, right?"


Hannah eyed him warily and stepped back, suspicion etched across her features. "Skiing? Why the sudden urge?"


Moments ago, they'd been locked in a heated argument. Now, with a flick of his tone, he was tossing out a ski trip invitation as if nothing had happened. She genuinely couldn't make sense of what was running through his mind.
Vincent offered a half-hearted explanation. "You've been run ragged organizing, my grandma's birthday.Figured you might want a break. Somewhere overseas."



What he kept to himself was that their constant bickering had worn them both thin, and after she'd gone out of her way to buy him a suit as a gift, maybe this trip could be their way back to each other. But Hannah's expression stayed stubbornly cool, not even a flicker of emotion breaking through.


"I've got things to do," Hannah replied, her tone flat as glass.



Vincent's expression shifted. "You don't want to go?"


She didn't hesitate. "Yeah. Skiing's boring."


His features hardened, a chill settling over him.They'd never even had a proper wedding-just a rushed honeymoon, holed up in a villa under Evrellia's towering, snow-draped mountains.


He still remembered that back then, they'd spent endless days watching flurries drift past the windows. Whenever the storm clouds finally cleared,she would slip her hand into his and coax him outside, her eyes bright with anticipation, eager for them to carve fresh trails across the untouched slopes. She'd once swore skiing was her greatest joy.But now she dismissed it, as if those memories meant nothing at all.


His breath snagged, but he forced his tone to remain steady. "The tickets are booked. Non-refundable."


A brittle laugh slipped from Hannah's lips. "Since when do you care about a couple of nonrefundable tickets?" Her gaze cut through him, glacial and unyielding."Why not take Brinley with you? She'd jump at the chance to hit the slopes with you. I'm not here to play games."


Vincent's jaw tensed, half his face swallowed by shadow. "I'm not negotiating with you."


Hannah lifted a brow, her cold smile icy and detached. "And I've already said no." Her voice dripped with contempt. "Are you going to force me again?"

###Chapter 98 A Box Of Birth Control Pills
With a heavy sigh, Vincent undid the top buttons of his shirt, trying to relieve the tension he felt. "So much has gone on lately," he muttered. "We haven't really talked things through in weeks. Maybe a ski trip would give us a chance to catch our breath-just the two of us, without any interruptions."


He quickly added, "But if you're not up for skiing, we can stay indoors at the villa there. Whatever you prefer."


The tension on Hannah's expression eased a bit.Vincent had a point. They'd been fighting nonstop,and every time she brought up divorce, he'd always brushed it aside as if she were just being dramatic.Perhaps it was time for a serious conversation to end their marriage.


If going on this ski trip meant escaping the Jones estate and finally having a chance to mention the divorce agreement Vincent had signed without realizing it, she'd take it. If he wanted any term to be changed, they could sort it all out at once.


Hannah relented. "What time are we leaving tomorrow?"


For the first time that night, the tension had finally faded from Vincent's face. "I'll text you the details soon."



Hannah nodded quietly. "I have something important to discuss with you tomorrow."


He paused, eyes flickering to the shopping bag on the desk, a small spark of hope igniting. He looked back at her, a new seriousness in his voice. "You can tell me now,if you want."


She shook her head. "Not tonight. I'm exhausted.Tomorrow."


"All right," he replied. "Just promise you won't forget." She shot him a look. "Aren't you going to leave?"


"Sleep tight," he said gently.


With that, Vincent walked out, and Hannah locked the door behind him.


An hour later, Vincent's message appeared on her phone. "Leaving at ten tomorrow. The private jet will be waiting in the courtyard."


She typed a brief "OK" in reply.


As she turned off for the night, sleep stayed out of reach, no matter how hard she tried. Whether it was anxiety or just the weight on her mind, she kept tossing and turning in bed.


Finally, she got up and rummaged through her drawer,hunting for some melatonin.


In her search, she nearly grabbed her birth control pills by mistake before finally finding what she needed. Without thinking, she set the birth control pills aside on her nightstand and then took two melatonin tablets. Only after that did her body finally relax enough to drift off.


The following morning, Hannah woke up later than usual. As she made her way toward the stairs, she heard Brinley shouting from the dining room. "You're going skiing with Hannah?"


Hannah frowned. Always so loud. So annoying.


During the breakfast, Brinley had just learned that Vincent had taken a day off. She'd been about to ask what his plans were-only to hear that he was going skiing with Hannah.


A wave of jealousy rushed through Brinley. She couldn't resist asking, "It's just going to be the two of you?"


Vincent, unfazed, replied with a simple "Yeah," his gaze flickering to the top of the stairs.


Sharon beamed with approval, "It's about time you took Hannah out for some fun."



Danica exchanged a glance with Brinley and then tried to keep her tone light. "Vincent, you know,
Brinley hasn't had a chance to get out much lately.Maybe she could tag along with you and Hannah?"


Sharon shot her an irritated look. "They're a married couple going on a trip together. How could Brinley tag along?"


Vincent said nothing.


With Sharon's disapproval clear,.Brinley had no choice but to smile through gritted teeth."I appreciate the thought, Mrs. Jones, but it really wouldn't be appropriate for me to tag along when Vincent and HHannah are going together as an item.That said, it has been a while since I last went skiing."


Her words faded away, eyes glistening with disappointment she'd deliberately let through.


Vincent's expression softened a touch. "If you really want to go skiing, I'll have Derek arrange a trip for you in a few days."


Brinley's head shot up, hope flickering in her gaze."Will you come with me?"
"| won't," Vincent answered. "My schedule's packed afterward. A lot is coming up."


He'd cleared his entire schedule to make room for a three-month break-this one day was already a luxury he had to fight to get.


Brinley felt a pang of disappointment. So this little trip was meant just for Hannah-something Vincent had set aside for Hannah alone. But weren't they still in a cold war? Did that mean they'd patched things up already?


Brinley looked down, trying to hide the frustration swirling in her eyes. "If you're not going, then what's the point?"


An uneasy silence settled over the table.


Danica started to interject but froze when Sharon shot her a firm gaze.


Turning her focus to Vincent, Sharon's tone grew serious. "Remember, Hannah doesn't handle the cold well.Pack extra layers for her."
Vincent let out a light laugh, still in high spirits. "It's just a quick trip, Grandma. We'll be fine."


"Quick trip or not, make sure she stays warm,"Sharon insisted.


Vincent smiled, reassuring as ever. "Don't fret. I'll look after her."


"I'm more worried you'll hurt her feelings again,"Sharon murmured under her breath, though she didn't say anything anymore. She'd seen enough to know how often Hannah was upset because of Vincent.


A flicker of discomfort crossed Vincent's face,making it clear he didn't want to linger on the conversation. "I'll go check on Hannah."


Brinley kept her head down, absently poking at her food.


Vincent climbed the stairs and paused outside the guest room.He tried to twist the handle. Locked. He rapped on the door. "Come on. Open up."

His knocking came fast and loud, enough to get on Hannah's nerves.



Annoyed, Hannah swung the door open, only to see Vincent waiting outside, a smile playing on his lips.


"What do you want?" she asked, her tone flat.


Vincent stepped inside without waiting for an invitation. "We're leaving soon.Are you packed?"


Hannah let out a tired breath. "Not yet. I haven't even washed my face."


Her morning had been spent going over Nova Tech's product updates with Felix and requesting the day off.



Vincent checked his watch. "No rush. You've got thirty minutes. Once you're ready, we'll go."


"Alright," Hannah muttered, rubbing her eyes and heading for the bathroom.


While she was gone, Vincent started gathering her things, tossing her skincare products into her bag-she couldn't use just anything with her sensitive skin.


As he zipped up the pouch, his eyes landed on a small botte left out on the nightstand.


He picked it up, and a chill ran through him as he realized what it was. Birth control? She was taking birth control?

###Chapter 99 You Really Want Another Woman To Have My Child
Hannah emerged from the bathroom,toweling off her damp hair, and found Vincent rooted to the spot. One of her bags had toppled over by his feet, but she barely glanced at him as she scooped it up. She realized he'd already packed away her skincare, so she quickly tossed in a few more essentials.


"We're good to go. Come on," Hannah said breezily.


Vincent remained motionless, his jaw clenched,icy eyes fixed on her.


Only now did Hannah register the stony tension in his face. She paused, brows knitting. "What's wrong?"


A dry, almost bitter laugh escaped Vincent. "What's wrong?" he repeated, his voice simmering with barely concealed anger. "You really don't know?"


Hannah's eyes narrowed, all patience gone. "If you've got something to say, just say it. I'm not interested in playing mind games right now."


His voice turned rough, barely controlled. "You're really going to act clueless? If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, would you have kept pretending nothing was going on?"


A sharp current ran through the room. Hannah's pulse skipped-had he found the divorce agreement?But she quickly steadied herself. Well, it was better that way. They wouldn't have to wait until the ski trip to talk. They could deal with it here and now.


Her tone stayed even, measured. "I wasn't trying to keep it from you."


He shot her a look of disbelief. "Not trying to keep it?" His laugh was cold and sharp. "You knew exactly what you were doing."


Vincent clenched his jaw, anger flickering in his eyes.They'd agreed to start a family-mostly for his grandmother, who kept hinting about a great-grandchild. But now, the truth hit him like a punch to the gut: Hannah had been quietly taking birth control all along.


"I acknowledge that I should've just told you about it sooner," Hannah replied, her voice steady, almost detached. "If you're on board, let's just get the divorce finalized."


He suddenly stepped in, looming over her with a stormy expression. "So that's it? You're popping pills behind my back because you want a divorce?"


She went utterly still. Pills? Her eyes flicked to his hand, her pulse skipping-he was clutching her birth control pills. She met his gaze, chin lifted."Yeah."


A fresh wave of anger surged through Vincent.He seized her wrist, his grip iron-tight. "When did you start taking them?"


"Just two days back." She jerked her arm free and backed away, forcing distance between them.


Vincent blinked. Just two day/s back, immediately after he'd taken her by force. His mind reeled.
 Suddenly, all those years without a child came rushing back, sharper than ever. His grandmother had long assumed it was a fertility problem, even going so far as to urge them to get checked. But now the truth crashed downon him-it had been her, all along. She'd been taking birth control the entire time.


He let out a cold, mocking laugh. "Two days back?Haven't you been taking the pills all this time? No wonder we've gone five years without a kid."


Hannah's breath caught in her throat. Her nails pressed so hard into her palm that they nearly broke skin. This was what it all came down to? A bottle of pills, and suddenly, he decided the blame for their childless marriage belonged solely to her.


A dull ache radiated through her chest, sharper than any argument. Unbidden, the memory of that tiny life she'd lost-gone barely a month in-flashed behind her eyes. She swallowed her pain and managed a brittle laugh. "You don't have the right to talk about children." He hadn't even known his own child had once existed. And he sure as hell didn't deserve to be a father now.


"I don't have the right?" His voice was rough, the words clipped with fury. A vein pulsed visibly at his temple as he let out a cold, hollow laugh. "I'm your husbànd. Who could possibly be more entitled than me?"


Disappointment flickered in his eyes, sharp as glass."You know how much Grandma cherished you. After everything, isn't it the least you can do? All she's ever dreamed of is seeing her great-grandchild."


Hannah stood silent for a heartbeat, wrestling with the truth of his words. If she owed anyone in the Jones family, it was Sharon. But what stung most wasn't the thought of failing to produce a child-it was knowing she'd denied Sharon the chance to keep her as a granddaughter-in-law. None of this was ever about the child. They were already on the verge of divorce-there was no sense dragging a baby into the wreckage of their marriage.


Hannah met his gaze with steady resolve. "So what?

Isn't that all she wants anyway-a great-grandchild?
If I can't give her one, let Brinley do it. She'd probably jump at the chance to carry on the Jones family name."



She tossed out the words like they meant nothing,her tone so casual that it cut straight through him.


Vincent's eyes flashed, a burning intensity in his stare that threatened to scorch everything in its path.She just kept pushing him toward another woman,over and over, treating him as if he were something disposable-an afterthought to be handed off without a second glance. Her coldness pressed in on him,suffocating.


His voice dropped to a rough, throaty whisper. "You really want another woman to have my child?"

###Chapter 100 Was He Really Going To Marry Brinley

"Why not? We're getting divorced anyway," Hannah remarked coldly as she crossed her arms.


Vincent had lost track of how many times she'd brought up ending things. An ache settled somewhere deep as he asked, "So you're dead set on divorcing me?"


No hesitation met his question. "Absolutely," Hannah answered, cold and unwavering.


Their eyes locked. Hannah was the first to look away.


Coldness slipped into Vincent's tone. "Are you sure you can actually handle life without me?" It was barely a question. He remembered clearly how, from the day they met, she'd always found a reason to be near him. He doubted she would actually walk away.


"I don't need you, Vincent. No one's irreplaceable,Hannah said,her voice steady as she raised her chin."I'll be better off without you,"


That declaration left him stunned and silent. Did she truly believe she'd be happier on her own? A hard glint came into his gaze. "Don't you ever take those birth control pills behind my back again. And as for this divorce idea-drop it."



Finality echoed in his voice, dismissing her request for a divorce entirely.


Hannah's frown deepened, her gaze holding steady.With measured determination, she said, "I mean it,Vincent. I really want a divorce."


Annoyance crept into his expression. "Unless you want me to tell my grandma about you taking those pills, I suggest you shut your mouth."


Hannah raised an eyebrow. "You won't tell her." Both of them cared about Sharon's condition too much to say anything to sour her mood and potentially cause her to faint from emotional distress.
 Leveling her tone, Hannah added, "Seriously, think about getting a divorce. I've made up my mind."


Watching Hannah's unwavering resolve made Vincent's temper spike. Ignoring her last remark, he spun around, yanked open the door, and leaned out over the railing. "Brinley!" he called out.


Downstairs, Brinley and Danica exchanged a quick,puzzled look. Neither had any idea what had just happened. Without wasting a moment, the two of them made their way up the stairs at a brisk pace.


With a cautious step, Brinley stopped at the landing."Is everything okay, Vincent? Did something happen?"


Vincent shot her a glance. "Didn't you want to go skiing? Get your things-we're leaving now."


Delight flashed in Danica's eyes. She tugged on Brinley's sleeve, unable to contain herself. "He's taking you, finally! What are you waiting for?"


Brinley tamped down her joy and said gently, still playing the thoughtful charade, "Vincent, perhaps I should pass. Your grandmother was right. I'd only be intruding on your time with Hannah."



"Only you and I are going," Vincent said flatly, his gaze never wavering from Hannah.


Both Brinley and Danica turned, eyes landing on Hannah for her reaction. Had Hannah and Vincent just gotten into an argument?


Barely reacting, Hannah quietly unpacked her bag,removing her belongings one by one. A calm farewell slipped from her lips. "Hope you both have a great time."



With that, she planted her hand on Vincent's shoulder and pushed him out the door. A loud bang followed as she slammed it shut behind him.



Annoyance simmered in Danica's expression. Who did Hannah think she was, treating Vincent so coldly?Hannah's behavior had grown more and more outrageous lately.
Every instinct told Danica to speak up, but she swallowed her irritation, remembering Vincent's decision to take Brinley for the skiing trip. The last thing she wanted was to see him take Hannah's side again, So, she forced a sweet smile and faced Vincent and Brinley. "Go on and enjoy yourselves.Have a wonderful time."



Delight shone in Brinley's eyes. "Thank you, Mrs.Jones."



With purposeful strides, Vincent set the pace, forcing Brinley to hurry just to keep up.


Already prepared, the private jet waited on the tarmac. Derek appeared and greeted Vincent with polished professionalism, his eyes lingering for just a second on Brinley walking close behind Vincent. A hint of surprise flickered across his face. Word on the grapevine might actually be true-was Vincent really going to marry Brinley?


Derek masked his curiosity, keeping his expression even as he escorted them aboard.
...


Free time stretched before Hannah, leaving her momentarily aimless. Work obligations were on hold for the day, and the last details of the birthday party preparation were now in the hands of event staff.


When her eyes landed on the shopping bag she brought back yesterday, an idea came to her.Delivering it to Miles at Sterling Heights sounded like a good way to spend her afternoon.


She scribbled a quick note, slipped it into the bag,and grabbed the bag on her way out.


Descending the stairs, she noted Danica leisurely sipping her coffee and wearing an air of contentment.


Danica looked pleased with herself. The instant her eyes landed on Hannah, she figured Hannah was full of regret for her earlier behavior and had come to chase after Vincent. With a smug smile, she said,"You're too late to chase them now. Brinley and Vincent left some time ago. There's no way you'll catch up."


A split-second pause was all it took for Hannah to catch Danica's meaning. No argument left her lips.Instead, she played along with a sly grin. "Maybe you're right. Maybe I should just fly directly to the ski resort and wait for Vincent there."


The suggestion sent Danica into a panic. "Hannah,don't do anything reckless!"


Laughter bubbled from Hannah, but she offered no further reply, heading straight out to her car.


No sooner had Hannah's car disappeared than Danica fired off a frantic message to Brinley."Hannah's had a change of heart-she's coming for Vincent!"
