###Chapter 1 Breakup Over A Damn Mug
Crack!

My fiancé hit me.

Three minutes ago,I had been daydreaming about how to decorate our ridiculously expensive penthouse apartment,where every corner looked like it belonged on the cover of a magazine.

Two minutes ago, I accidentally broke a mug.

Then,Rhys slapped me across the face-hard.

My cheek burned like it had been seared by fire. It took a full thirty seconds before my brain restarted,slowly piecing reality back together.

"Are you fucking insane?" I gritted my teeth, forcing the words through the cracks of my jaw.

Rhys's lips were pressed into a cold, tight line, his expression dark and resolute. "It was just a mug with Catherine's face on it," he said, as if my reaction was an overblown performance, not the result of something horrifying he had just done.

"You have got to be fucking kidding me." I stared at him in disbelief, my chest heaving as rage and humiliation churned violently inside me, ready to explode.
For half a second-just half-something like guilt flickered across his face. Then it vanished, consumed by a storm of fury.

"No,you're the insane one!" he roared. "L already agreed to marry you-what more do you want?Catherine's gone, but you still broke that mug on purpose!"

His voice trembled with anger. "She was your sister!She had to leave because of you! And now you're jealous of her? You won't rest until every trace of her is erased,will you?"

The hatred in his eyes cut deeper than the slap.

My cheek throbbed. My hand was still bleeding. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

I forced myself to unclench my jaw and made one last attempt to explain. "It wasn't me. I never asked her to leave."


Technically speaking, I understood why someone might say that. Catherine had left behind a letter. In it,she said she'd seen my diary, realized I had a crush on Rhys, and decided to "let go," to "let him be yours."

I don't think she ever understood that a diary meant privacy. I never meant for anyone to read it, but not only did she read it-she told everyone.

No one cared about the pain I felt when my secret was exposed. I was dragged out, nailed to a pillar of shame,forced to pay for her so-called noble sacrifice.
 To my family, it was like I'd been bumped up to the starting lineup out of nowhere, replacing the golden girl-l should've been grateful. Even if Rhys had stabbed me in the gut, they'd still find a way to excuse it.

It was as if my parents had always hated me. No matter how much better | did than Catherine, they always saw me as bitter, as someone who couldn't protect her fragile pride.

The searing pain on my cheek intensified.

My fingers clenched tightly around the engagement ring. A wave of heat-anger, humiliation,resentment-rose in my throat,

Hot tears welled in my eyes, blurring my vision.I blinked fast, wiping them away before they could fall.

I would not cry. I would never show weakness in front of him.


I took a heavy step toward the door, struggling to move. I had to get out of there, or I would completely fall apart. Whatever shred of dignity I had left-l couldn't let it be destroyed in front of this man.

Rhys suddenly grabbed my wrist and yanked me back."Clean it up."

I looked up at him in disbelief, needing to confirm I'd heard him right.

"You broke the mug. You clean up the pieces." His voice was icy, absolute.
He had to be insane.

"No." I lifted my chin and spat the word without an ounce of compromise.

His face tightened, jaw clenched. "You sure you want to do this?"

"Yes. I said no." Mly eyes were red, but they blazed with defiance as I stared him down without flinching

If love meant I had to grind my self-respect into the dirt, then it was worthless to me.

The air between us was taut enough to snap. I could almost hear it crackling. The fury in his eyes was an uncontrollable blaze, threatening to consume me.And beneath that fire, I saw something else-disbelief. The once docile little lamb had bared her fangs.

He took a step closer, menace radiating from him."Last chance. If you don't obey me,then we-"

"-are over," I finished for him, cold and final.

Shock froze his face. For a moment, the air went still.He hadn't expected me to actually say it.

While he was caught in that moment of confusion,I wrenched my arm free from his grip. The taste of freedom hadn't yet bloomed in my chest when he snapped back to life, grabbing my arm again with brutal force.


Now.

I spun around,without hesitation and raised my hand-smack! A resounding slap landed hard across Rhys's  handsome, arrogant face.

The air froze again, thick with silence

My palm tingled slightly, but it brought a rush of fierce,unprecedented satisfaction.

Rhys staggered back a few steps, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief-not from the pain, but from a world turned upside down. He never thought I would dare. After all, I had once loved him so deeply

I lowered my hand, lifted my chin,and looked calmly at his stunned expression. I gave him a faint smile."Now we're even."


Without waiting another moment, I dragged my feet away from that suffocating hell.

If I stayed even one more second, I would break down.I'd rather choke on my own tears than let him see them fall.

Then-thud-I fell.

High heels and emotional chaos are a terrible match.

Pain shot through my palms and knees as they scraped against the hard marble. Blood surged out instantly, but I barely felt it.

I got up, grabbed my purse, and kept walking

Home.I just wanted to go home. Away from all of this.Away from him.

Like a woman fleeing the scene of a crime, I burst out of the building-only to slam into a wall of muscle and the intoxicating scent of expensive cologne I looked up-and saw sharp, sculpted features with an aura so commanding it could silence a room. He looked like the kind of man who, if you pissed him off,wouldn't just ruin your life-he'd erase your entire existence.

Unfortunately, that only made him more attractive.

For a second, I wished he would throw me over his shoulder and carry me to his lair-my face flushed red instantly. If thnis were a porno, the camera angle would be an absolute disaster.


I snapped myself back to reality.

"Sorry," I mumbled and rushed into the elevator of my apartment building.

Back upstairs, I rummaged through my bag. My heart sank.


No keys.

Of course. The universe had clearly declared today The End of Mira Day.

Frustration and helplessness surged in my chest.I kicked off my heels and shook the doorknob violently.It didn't help-but I needed to let it out. Why did everyone always choose Catherine?! Hadn't I done enough?

| collapsed against the wall, sliding down to the cold floor as sobs tore from my throat. The tears came in a flood, impossible to stop.

Just as I was nearly choking on my own cries, a voice -low, smooth, like black velvet-cut through the air behind me.


"Your key."

Fury sparked in my veins. Why did someone always interrupt me just when I was about to get it all out?

Annoyed, I turned, ready to glare-only to freeze.

Through tear-blurred eyes, I saw him again. The man I had bumped into downstairs-the one who looked like he had stepped out of a Renaissance painting.

"Your key fell," he said, raising an eyebrow as his gaze landed on the scattered contents of my purse. "That's probably why you couldn't find it."

I stared at the key resting in his elegant hand,my face flushing so hot it could've lit a match. I snatched it from him and fumbled to unlock the door, stumbling inside without a word.

It wasn't until my back hit the door that I realized-l hadn't even thanked him.


Great job, Mira. You absolute idiot.

Hesitating, I crept toward the peephole. Through that tiny lens, I saw him calmly turn, unlock the door directly across the hall, and stroll inside.

He lived across from me?


He must have just moved in. With a face like that-and that aura-there's no way | wouldn't have noticed before.

Wait, Mira. What are you doing? You're seriously letting a hot new neighbor make you forget the hell Rhys just put you through?

No. Absolutely not. All men are trash. Always.

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to steady my racing heartbeat,reminding myself not to be so stupid again But no matter how hard I tried, that sculpted face kept flashing through my mind.

I needed ice-for my racing pulse, and more urgently,for the stinging pain on my cheek.

Just as I forced myself up to head to the kitchen, my phone rang,shrill and sharp.

One glance at the screen made my whole body go cold.


Mom.


I couldn't igore the call. If I did, she would destroy my career without hesitation. She was absolutely capable of it.

The moment I picked up, her voice sliced through the air-cold and merciless.

"Mira, you must be insane! How dare you do something so disgraceful to Rhys! You apologize to him right now, or you're no longer our daughter!"

I opened my mouth to explain, stunned-but she hung up before I could get a single word out.

I gripped my phone tightly. Why was it that no matter how hard I tried, I still couldn't earn even a sliver of their love? And Catherine-she never had to do anything, yet she was their perfect,precious jewel.

Enough.

I thought if I worked hard enough, my family. my fiancé-they would love me.

But that's never going to happen.

I have to reclaim the self-respect I lost long ago.

I have to break off this engagement with Rhys-no matter the consequences.
 ###Chapter 2 Plan B



For the next forty-eight hours, I became one with my bed.

No calls. No outside world. Just me, a pile of blankets,and the crushing weight of humiliation.

That slap from Rhys wasn't just a blow to the face. In so many ways, it was a slap across my entire life-one steeped in desperation, delusion, and pathetic longing.It forced me awake. It made me look back on everything I'd ever done to make him notice me,everything I'd done for a fantasy called "us" that had never truly existed.

God,where do l even begin?

Like the time he casually mentioned he liked girls with smooth, silky hair. That night, I ordered three bottles of the shampoo he'd once praised. My scalp broke out in hives. I smiled through the pain and said, "It's fine-some allergic reactions are worth it."

Or when he told me he was too busy with work to grab dinner, so I stayed up learning howv to bake and brought him a box of pastries in the rain. He didn't even open the door-just had the receptionist tell me,"Don't bother next time. I don't like sweets."

Then there was that night at his friend's dinner party.I forced down oysters-my most hated food-just to seem "graceful and agreeable." I spent the entire night crouched over a toilet, writhing in pain until 3 a.m.He didn't ask if I was ok<ay. He laughed and said, "Can't even handle seafood? That's just dramatic."


But the worst?


That time he quoted a line from The Godfather he liked. I stayed up all night reading film essays just to casually drop the quote at a party. I got it wrong. He corrected me in front of everyone, sneering, "Don't pretend to like things you clearly don't understand."

And I laughed. I laughed and said, "You've got such a good memory."

What a joke. I never realized I was never the person he wanted.

He never really saw me. To him, I was nothing more than a low-rent version of the "perfect and untouchable" Catherine. A cheap stand-in.

I wasn't her, but I could offer him the faint illusion of having her again. That was all I was good for.

I buried my face in the pillow and laughed until I shook.Not because it was funny-but because the pain had gone too deep for tears.

Thankfully, after my parents delivered their final ultimatum two days ago, they hadn't contacted me again.

A small part of me wondered-did Rhys intervene? Did he finally realize what he'd done?
Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

And it didn't stop ringing.

For a full five minutes.

I groaned into my pillow. Oh god. Social interaction.

Dragging my exhausted body to the door, I opened it.

Yvaine Carlisle-my best friend and the only person who had the legal right to yell at me-stood on the other side, hands on hips. Then her eyes landed on my face.

Her expression froze. The light in her eyes dimmed."What the hell happened to you?"

"I'm fine," | said,trying to sound casual. She wasn't buying it.

She reached out, gently tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. Her jaw clenched.

Then-silence.


Not the awkward kind. The dangerous kind.The kind that comes right before something explodes

"Who hit you?"

"Come inside," I muttered quickly, trying not to draw the neighbors' attention. That would be mortifying.

Yvaine didn't move. She gripped my arm and spoke through gritted teeth. "Mira. Who.Hit.You?"

As soon as the door clicked shut, I collapsed into her arms. My face buried in her sweater, and within seconds, the fabric was soaked.
She didn't flinch. She just held me, her hand moving in calm, soothing circles across my back.

I didn't know how long I cried. Long enough for my throat to burn and my nose to turn bright red like Rudolph. Eventually, I managed to force out a single word.


"Rhys."

Yvaine didn't move.

Everyone in Skyline City knew that name. Rhys Granger wasn't the kind of man who needed to throw punches to destroy someone. One phone call to the right person, and your life would be over. Reputation,money,status-he had it all.

Every move he made was deliberate, timed to perfection-like the ticking of a Rolex. When he chose to go to war, he was a nobleman wielding cruelty like fine art, probably with a glass of aged Scotch in hand.

People called him arrogant. No one ever called him violent.

That's why, when Yvaine processed what I'd just said,I could practically hear the gears in her brain screaming in protest.

"No way," she muttered under her breath, as if denying it out loud might somehow make it untrue. "Rhys?Your Rhys? He couldn't have..."

I got it. I really did. Rhys was supposed to be the gentleman. The golden boy. The flawless, elegant,
untouchable good guy.

"It was him," I said quietly

She exhaled sharply, then started rubbing my back again, this time slower. "Tell me what happened."

I swallowed. "I was at his place. l, uh... accidentally broke a mug."

Her entire body tensed. "Just a mug?"

I nodded.


Silence. Then she clenched her jaw and said, "I swear to God, if you tell me it was some priceless, hand-crafted,one-of-a-kind family heirloom-"

"It was Catherine's mug."

Yvaine's hand froze mid-pat.

Everything shifted. One second, she was my concerned best friend. The next, she was a woman plotting murder.

I grabbed her wrist before she could get ahold of something worse. "It's over between Rhys and me."

"Really?"

"Really. Even if the earth split in two and Skyline City sank into the ocean, I wouldn't marry him."

That stopped her from storming out to commit homicide.


"Catherine. That venomous snake-" Yvaine spat the name like it physically hurt her. "She's not even here anymore and she's still managing to wreck your life!
And your parents? They just stand there watching! I swear, they could watch her light your house on fire and they'd hand her the matches. It's unbelievable!"

I felt like a balloon someone had just popped-deflated,exhausted.That all-too-familiar ache settled deep in my chest. I knew some parents would always love their firstborn more. And there was nothing l could do about it.

"I'm sorry, Mira."

Yvaine sat down beside me and gave my head a firm push toward her shoulder. I pulled away and managed a weak smile. "Actually, I think it's a good thing. At least I found out,what kind of man he is before we got married. Better now than after the vows, right?"

She let out a long sigh, her eyes softening. "Mira,you know no matter what happens, I've got your back."

Right then, my stomach growled loud enough to interrupt the moment. Loudly.

Like a magician, Yvaine reached behind her and pulled out a takeout bag, giving me a look that practically screamed: I knew you'd be like this.

I wanted to hug her, but I was too busy eating like a ravenous little goblin.

After dinner, she pushed me into the bedroom and went off to clean up. I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling, drained and overwhelmed.What now?

Through the half-open door,I heard her on the phone.
I didn't catch every word, but the ones I did hear..were iconic.


"A pile of shit."

"Total fucking psycho."

"Oh, you think that's bad? Wait till I tell you what this violent bastard actually did-"

She was probably talking to Zane Hasterton. And unlike Rhys, Zane would never raise a hand to her.

The way Yvaine so instantly, so fiercely chose me-without hesitation, without question-made my throat tighten. She believed me. No one else did. But she did.

This wasn't something she did lightly. Rhys's family sat at the very top of the food chain-untouchable.And I had no doubt her parents wouldn't be thrilled to see her go up against them.

I curled deeper under the blanket and let out a slow breath.


Why couldn't my parents love me like that?

Ever since their favorite daughter Houdini'd her way out of their master plan, I became Plan B. But that didn't mean they forgave my existence.

Let's be honest: the only reason they'd stopped actively berating me was because I got engaged to Rhys. That little arrangement somehow elevated me from "irreparable family disgrace" tootential saving grace."

Part of the reason I agreed to the engagement-and know how pathetic this sounds-was because | thought maybe I could finally get something Catherine had: a sliver of parental affection. A crumb of approval.

But now that the engagement was off?

I was disposable again.

Last I heard, they were boxing up my things, ready to ship me off to some remote jungle where I'd spend the rest of my life befriending anacondas and repenting for my sins.

They were absolutely capable of that.

I groaned into my pillow. What the hell do I do now?

Unless... I married,someone more powerful than Rhys.

The idea was so ridiculous I snorted. Right. Because billionaires are just wandering around Skyline City hoping to marry a 23-year-old orphan with no patience for their bullshit.

And yet-

A face flashed in my mind.

Three days ago. My new neighbor.

I remembered, quite inappropriately, thinking l wouldn't mind being alone with him in his apartment where he could do all sorts of rated-R things to me.

I shook my head, quickly banishing the thought.I didn't even know his name. Just that he had the kind of aura that could slice a person in half.

No. Way too dangerous.
I groaned again.

If I hadn't broken that stupid mug, everything might've been okay.

But it wasn't. And it's not. And there's no going back.

Fuck! Why am I the one trying to fix this when I wasn't even the one who messed it up?! I sat up-and bam,the door burst open.

Yvaine marched in. "Sleep is just going to make you feel worse. We're getting up, and we're going to find a dick worth loving-one that's better than Rhys's."


WHAT?!


While I gaped, she had already changed me into a new outfit.


Just like that, we were off to Skyline City's most exclusive club-members only.
###Chapter 3 Rebound Night

"Is this really necessary?" I stood at the end of the line,shivering, tugging desperately at the hem of my tragically short skirt. I could practically feel it-if |opened my mouth to speak, my underwear would be on full display.

"Sweetheart,we paid a fortune to get into this place.Of course we're going all in. Do you not get it?"Yvaine declared,like a mafia queen, standing tall against the icy wind in her five-inch heels without the slightest trace of fear.

"But isn't this a little too-" | didn't even get to finish before a brutal gust of wind slapped me across the face likeit had a personal vendetta. I immediately zipped up my puffer jacket and curled into myself like a frozen shrimp.

Yvaine let out a dramatic groan. "Mira, come on.We're going to a bar, not an Arctic expedition."

"I'm just glad I won't be hospitalized for hypothermia tonight, thanks," I snapped back.

She rolled her eyes so hard I thought they might fall out, gave me a once-over full of disappointment-but said nothing more. Small victory. My puffer jacket was safe-for now.
 I'd thought we'd have to wait in line like everyone else.That was the whole reason I wore this thermal fortress of a coat. But clearly, I had underestimated Yvaine.

She had zero plans to follow the rules.

With the ease of someone who'd done this a thousand times, she slipped a rolled-up bill into the bouncer's hand, her palm casually grazing his rock-hard chest like a Bond girl who'd forgotten her martini.

Ten seconds. That's all it took. We were in.


Yvaine was the kind of beautiful that made men forget protocol-and ethics-in an instant.

And just like that, we breezed into Roxanne.

The place was thick with heat, perfume, and the effervescent scent of champagne. I ripped off my coat the second we stepped inside, only to be met with an are-you-trying-to-embarrass-me glare from Yvaine.


She handed her coat off to a passing server with a flick of her fingers, like she'd personally hired the man.Regal,effortless, born for this.

I tried to copy her moves. Failed miserably. Nearly dropped my purse and stumbled like a hamster who'd just woken up from a freezer nap.

Graceful? No. I looked like roadkill in Gucci heels

If I hadn't known each cocktail here cost about the same as my checking account balance, I might've even convinced myself I was pulling it off.
"Jesus Christ!" I gasped, eyes glued to the menu like it had just insulted my entire bloodline.

Yvaine gave me a sideways glance and scoffed. "Relax.Tonight's on me."

I exhaled with something dangerously close to gratitude. Considering I'd nearly broken off an engagement, risked being exiled to some remote tropical island by my parents, and needed to budget for anti-snake spray, I needed all the charity I could get.

Price tags aside, the view was elite: ambitious young actors, outrageously good-looking models, and a legion of finance bros who looked like they gave TED talks while wearing Burberry.

It was a glittering buffet of vanity and hormones,wrapped in velvet lighting and the illusion of power.

We found a table near the bar and hadn't even ordered drinks when a bartender locked eyes on us.

Well. He was hard to miss-tall, sculpted features sleeves rolled to the elbows just enough to show off well-trained forearms.

He shouldn't be mixing drinks-he should be in the Louvre. Or at the very least starring in Dior's newest fragrance campaign. Maybe that's why this club was so expensive: even the staff had to be perfect.

"Two 75s,French brandy,"

Before I could even locate the cheapest drink on the menu, Yvaine had already tossed her order at the bartender. "Make it strong."

And of course, she didn't forget to flash her signature smile-the one that balanced perfectly between sexy and innocent, chin tilted just enough to say	"Oops,didn't mean to flirt."


The bartender reached effortlessly for the gin, giving her a half-smile. "Rough night?"

"More like an engagement-level disaster," she said,casually pointing her thumb at me. "And it's wrapping up real soon."

I glanced at her. "Thrilled that my personal life is nOW public broadcast."

She patted my hand with mock sympathy. "Sweetie,this place runs on romantic catastrophes. Without bad decisions, no one would be buying drinks."

Then she turned away and melted into the crowd,flipping into Social Queen Mode like someone had hit a switch.

In under ten seconds, she completed a visual sweep-like a hawk zeroing in on prey-before spinning back around and pointing her perfectly manicured finger toward the edge of the dance floor.

"Okay, listen. You need a rebound. Exhibit A:Six-foot -two, hair neater than your ex-fiancé's moral compass,shirt unbuttoned just enough to scream sexy without slipping into cheap. He either owns a yacht or,at the very least, a VIP card."
I shook my head. "Nope."

Her eyes flicked to a new direction. "Exhibit B: struggling musician. Dressed like payday hasn't happened yet, but he's hot enough you'd forgive him You'd fund his next album and still sleep like a baby.""Pass."


She sighed, then pointed again. "Fine. Exhibit C: total dad vibes-but the good kind. Like 'books your doctor's appointment and your breakfast' dad, not 'calls the waitress 'sweetheart' and thinks climate change is a myth' dad."


I groaned into my hands. "Yvaine, please."

She didn't back down. "Mira, you cannot sit here like a decorative wall gecko. Tonight is about rebooting your life, not stitching up emotional wounds." 1

Just as she geared up for a fourth round of rebound recommendations, she suddenly froze. It was like someone had hit mute on her entire system.

Then, far too casually, she said, "Hey, want to hit the bathroom?"


I narrowed my eyes."No?"

"...Or maybe let's move tables? The vibe here's weird."Her smile was tight, and her voice cracked like a pair of worn-out heels.

Weird vibe? We'd only been sitting for ten minutes,and we just ordered drinks. By Yvaine's standards, we hadn't even made it past the opening credits.
Then I followed her gaze.

A half-private booth.

Rhys.

He had his arm draped around a woman. Her head rested on his shoulder, makeup flawless, smile polished and effortless.

I didn't need more details.

That face-I would never forget it.

Four years ago, a girl vanished under mysterious circumstances. I, in all my na?ve glory, believed she had simply "stepped aside," choosing to selflessly walk away fromn a future with Rhys.

And now, here was Catherine-perched on my ex-fiancé's lap, locked in a pose so intimate it looked less like a casual bar date and more like a budget version of Fifty Shades of Grey.

I had told myself I was over it. Over him. We'd broken up. It was done. Time to move on.

Until I heard what came next.

"Honestly, I didn't think she'd fall apart over a coffee mug."


Catherine's voice was soft, full of false pity-the kind that sounded like she'd just killed someone and was now gently tucking a blanket over the body.

She gently swirled the wine in her glass, her lips curling into a near-perfect smile. "Of course I put that mug somewhere obvious. I wanted her to notice.
After all, she still doesn't know you've been seeing me behind her back. It was time she caught a little hint,wasn't it?"


She looked up at Rhys, eyes glowing with admiration."Honestly though, darling, your performance was spot -on. Even I almost believed you were worried she'd find out about us, instead of just helping me pull off the scene. She's so stupid-of course she thought you were upset about the mug, not terrified of exposing your affair."


Rhys chuckled softly, smug and relaxed. "I had to act like | cared. She spends every day trying to be the perfect girlfriend. If she found out all her effort still couldn't compete with you, she'd lose it."

Catherine laughed under her breath and patted his chest. "Don't worry. Knowing Mira, she's probably still scrambling to fix things. She's the type who always believes that if she just tries hard enough, people will finally see her worth."

Her laugh turned soft, laced with pity so sharp it felt like a blade. "But the harder she tries, the more pathetic she looks. And me? I just 'happened' to return home. Her parents don't know a thing. They didn't even get the chance to stop me. Tomorrow, I'll be seeing them in broad daylight-because she gave up the engagement herself, and you, dear, are blameless."

Catherine leaned back with a triumphant sigh. "Isn't this the best 'ending? I never gave up on you. I was just waiting for her to step aside."
Rhys nodded slowly, a small smirk on his lips. "You're right. You always are."

A loud roar rang in my ears, and my heartbeat pounded against my skull like a war drum.

Yvaine must've been saying something-pleading with me to stay calm, not to do anything stupid-but l didn't hear a word.


I wasn't the same Mira who swallowed her pride for praise anymore.

I slipped free from Yvaine's grip and turned to the bartender."Your best red. Put it on Rhys Granger's tab."

The bartender-bless his beautiful, rule-breaking soul -didn't even flinch. He handed me the bottle like I'd just ordered mineral water.

With the bottle in hand, I had a mission. A singular,burning purpose.

The bouncer moved to stop me, but one look at my face-like a vengeful goddess straight from hell-made him wisely back off, hands raised in surrender.

I marched straight toward Rhys and Catherine. They were lip-locked in some dramatic, second-rate soap opera make-out scene.

I raised the bottle-and smashed it, with all my strength.

Glass shattered with a sharp crack, spraying across the table. Rhys's forehead split instantly, a trail of blood beginning to drip down between his brows.

Catherine screamed and leapt off his lap. "Mirabelle?!
Are you insane?! What are you doing here?!"

She scrambled to find a lie, panic rising in her voice."You're misunderstanding, it's not what you think-"

Rhys cut her off, his hand gripping her arm,his gaze dark and cold. "Don't bother explaining, Catherine. It doesn't matter. My parents will take your side, no matter what. We're just correcting an old mistake."

Catherine's panic twisted into smugness in an instant.She curled into his side with sickening sweetness and cooed,"Oh,honey, your head's bleeding. We have to get to the hospital."

Before I could say anything, Yvaine rushed to my side,fury radiating from every pore. She raised her hand,ready to slap Catherine straight back to whatever pit she'd crawled out of. "You disgusting,two-faced bitch 


I grabbed her wrist, steady and cold. "Yvaine,let them go. If they stay here one more second, I might lose my appetite permanently."

I locked eyes with Catherine's smug little face and raised my voice deliberately. "After all, the theme of this place is premium taste, not some clearance aisle for secondhand trash."

Catherine's smile froze on her lips. Rhys's face darkened, but they had no chance to respond.

Yvaine,emboldened,lifted her chin and sneered at the bouncers. "Well? What are you waiting for? Kindly escort these two walking health code violations off  the premises."
###Chapter 4 Key Guy
As soon as they were gone, Yvaine dragged me out of the club.

Damn it. I hated that Catherine had predicted every single thought running through my mind.

Yes, I was still considering salvaging my relationship with Rhys.

But now? The truth was right there, unmistakable and raw-they'd been sleeping together behind my back all along. And me? I was just the foolish, unnecessary third wheel in their twisted little story.

What I couldn't figure out was-why had Catherine faked her disappearance four years ago? What exactly had she been hiding? And why come back now?

My eyes stung.I tilted my head toward the sky, forcing the tears back.

Fine. Catherine's back. Perfect. Now they could all reunite like a happy little four-piece family?, and1...1was finally free.

"Mira... I'm so sorry. I had no idea they'd be there tonight. I didn't even know Catherine was back."Yvaine's eyes were full of regret.

I gave a bitter laugh and shook my head. "Neither did But I heard it loud and clear-they've been screwing around for a while. To them, I was just in the way."

"Those goddamn assholes!" Yvaine hissed through clenched teeth. "You should tell your parents. Let them know Catherine's not the perfect angel they think she is. What about Rhys's parents? No way they'll tolerate a scandal like this."

| was quiet for a moment. Yvaine had a point-Rhys's parents were the only people who had supported me.But he was their son. They wouldn't choose me over him. Not in the end.

And my parents? I let out a breath, heavy and tired."You know better than anyone-they only care about Catherine. No matter what I do, I'll never replace her."

Yvaine grabbed my shoulders, worry darkening her gaze. "So what now? You're just going to let them humiliate you?"

"Maybe." My voice dropped to a whisper, a weariness weighing it down. "Maybe if I accept it, it'll finally be over."


Suddenly, Yvaine's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, her brows knitting in frustration. "Mira, my agent just called. There's a last-minute ad shoot-1have to go now. Can you get home on your own?"

I nodded, managing a faint smile."Go. Don't worry about me. I'll call when I get back."

After she left, I hailed a cab. Instinctively, I gave the driver my home address. But barely two minutes into  the ride, a wave of suffocating pressure settled over me.


"No, wait," I said quickly. "Take me to a bar. Any bar.Just... far away from Roxanne."

The driver didn't blink-clearly used to the erratic demands of Skyline City's broken-hearted.

We eventually pulled up outside some unfamiliar nightclub. Velvet ropes. A crowd of influencer-types wielding selfie sticks. I didn't bother checking the name. I handed the bouncer some bills and strode inside.


Straight to the bar.

"Whiskey sour. Large. Keep them coming."

"Ma'am, maybe you should slow down," the bartender said gently, concern in his voice.

I slammed my empty glass on the counter and shoved my card across. "Did I stutter? Top me off."

The bartender sighed but obliged.

"That guy's right," a smooth, magnetic voice murmured beside me. "Too much alcohol can impair cognitive function and judgment. Unless you want to wake up in a stranger's bed tonight-"

I turned, irritated-then froze.

It was him.


The man from last night. My new neighbor. The one who'd handed me my keys with all the casual elegance of a Renaissance statue.
"Well, well. You again." I raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at my lips. "You really can't resist other people's business, huh?"

He chuckled softly, completely unfazed. "Think of it as a well-developed instinct for being helpful."

I gave an exaggerated sigh. "You're a hero, truly. But I don't need saving, Mr. Key Man."

"I know," he said calmly, lifting his glass and taking a slow sip. His eyes were clear and sharp. "But you do seem in desperate need of clarity."

I frowned. "'Is this how you treat all your neighbors?First their keys, then their dignity?"

He laughed-a low, rich sound. "Only when the neighbor looks like she's on the verge of self-destruction."

"...But I am always self-destructing," | muttered,suddenly quieter. "Doesn't it seem kind of pathetic?Like my whole life is just one mess after another?"

He didn't laugh. He didn't rush to reassure me,either.He didn't even deny what I'd just said.

He just looked at me. Calm. Quiet.Like he was watching a slow-motion disaster unfold-but had no intention of stopping it.

"You're not wrong," he finally said, his voice low and steady. "You are pretty good at making a mess of things. Like right now-you can't even stand properly and you're still demanding more alcohol."
I froze,frowning instinctively

But he went on, his tone unhurried-like he was flipping through a book and had landed on a sentence he already knew by heart:

"But strangely, you always seem to meet someone who refuses to walk away... right before everything falls apart."

I stared at him, half in shock, half in suspicion. you...flirting with me?"

He gave me a slow smile, his eyes lazily curving with just the right amount of mischief. His voice came out smooth and provocative, like velvet wrapped around steel. "Does it make you feel any better?"

His voice was low and warm, like whiskey being poured into a glass at midnight-just a little dizzying,just a little dangerous. He looked at me with an intensity that felt nearly uncontrollable, like he might lean in close and whisper things in the dark, on a bed,asking if his touch was hard enough.

My heart skipped a beat. My cheeks flushed instantly.My fingertips tightened against the edge of the bar.

I had to look at him properly. Really see him.

That face-it wasn't just handsome. It had the kind of quiet,devastating maturity that no amount of cologne and hair gel could fake. Not the kind you'd find among the over-groomed boys who danced to house music like they were owed the world.
\A wild, uninvited thought flashed through my mind

If I let him walk awvay tonight, maybe I was rejecting one of those rare, merciful moments when fate offered a second chance.


Before I could stop myself, my hand wrapped around the sleeve of his suit jacket. I rose from the barstool,heart pounding.

"So, Mr.Keys," I said, my voice hoarse but firm, "since you're so committed to helping... why not help all the way?"

He clearly hadn't expected that. His brow lifted slightly, surprise flickering across his face-but he didn't step back. He didn't laugh. He simply said, calm and steady:

"Of course. As long as this is something you won't deny when you're sober."

"I'm sure." | answered without hesitation.


Gripping his wrist tighter, I pulled him through the crowd and out of the bar.


The night wind struck us like a cleansing slap, city lights flickering above.

I didn't let myself pause. No time to think, no space for regret

We crossed the street. Entered the nearest hotel lobby.

Because tonight, I needed to know if I had the courage to accept what fate had placed in front of me.
It must have been one hell of a night, because when I woke up, sunlight was spilling through the curtains,and the red LED numbers of the digital clock blinked 10:07 AM at me with the judgmental smugness of a nun catching you sneaking out of the church.

The sheets still carried his scent-bergamot and sin-and my body buzzed from the lingering aftershocks of what we'd done.

I stared at the ceiling and thought: That was absolutely phenomenal sex.

The kind that wrecks you, delights you, and makes you stupid enough to want another round.

I ached everywhere-in the best, most regrettable way.

But my head... my head was a battlefield. It felt like a hundred tiny jackhammers were drilling through my skull. The alcohol from last night had declared mutiny,and my brain was paying the price, like someone had jammed a red-hot poker through my temple.

I had no idea how much | drank-definitely more than I should've.


The details had vanished into a fog thicker than a London morning.

Groaning, I rolled out of bed. Groaned again. Began gathering the scattered pieces of my clothing

The plan was simple: Get dressed. Sneak out. Pretend this never happened.

I had just picked up my skirt when a voice stopped me.
"Leaving so soon?"

Shit.


I turned-very slowly, thanks to the hangover and the shame-and saw him standing in the bathroom doorway,a towel slung low on his hips.

Droplets clung to his abs, catching the morning light,trailing down the deep V of his torso.

I stared. Unashamed.

Images from the night before surged back into my brain. I suddenly felt... very, very thirsty

"We need to talk," he said.

 ###Chapter 5Proposal



"We need to talk."


He stood in front of me, his voice disturbingly calm-as if he were announcing the fridge had broken, not that I had thrown him onto a bed the night before.

Talk?


My brain instantly began sorting through possibilities.Talk about what? A debrief? A review? Was he proposing some kind of... "long-term sexual partnership"?

Definitely not a proposal. That sort of thing only happens in soap operas written by people with hopelessly romantic minds.

Was he worried I'd cling to him?

After all-it was me who started this.

I was the one who dragged him out of the bar.

I was the one who opened the hotel door.

I was the one who pinned him down without a second thought.

"Look," I said, adopting the most mature, responsible tone I could muster, "last night was a mistake. A reckless,impulsive,but...undeniablyenjoyablemistake."
I tried not to look at his shoulders. Nor at his chest.Not at the water droplets sliding down his collarbone,tracing over sculpted muscle.

"I'm not going to ask you to take responsibility.I won't call you crying about emotional trauma. I'm not that kind of girl."

He didn't say anything.

Seeing no reaction, I turned to the door-aiming for a graceful exit, complete with a closure monologue.

But just as my hand reached the doorknob, a warm,wet palm landed on the back of mine.


I froze. Slowly,I turned around.

He was looking at me with an expression I couldn't place-somewhere between surprise and...seriousness.

"You don't remember me?" he asked softly.

I blinked, caught off guard. I answered quickly, almost defensively:"Of course I do. You're my new neighbor.Helped me find my keys the other night."

Technically true. Totally accurate.

What I didn't say-and never would-was that even without those trivial interactions, I remembered him

That face was unforgettable.

Or, more precisely, that face standing in front of me in just a white towel, with water dripping down those abS...yeah. Not something easily erased from memory.

I swallowed hard.
The trick was: don't look directly at him. Like an eclipse.

Too bad that strategy had completely failed.

Worse still, even though I was fully dressed and he was practically naked, somehow, under his gaze, I felt like the one who was completely exposed

I tried to speak-to say something, anything to shift the focus.


But he didn't press further. He just stood there,watching me, as if waiting for the moment my real reaction would finally come.

The silence stretched.

Then he said, "It's fine. Doesn't matter."

I blinked.What?


"Can I go now?" | asked dryly. His hand still hadn't moved.


He looked at me again, then-unhurriedly-said:

"Will you marry me?"


...


What?!


"You're not serious." I finally found my voice.

"I'm completely serious," he replied, as if he were announcing a quarterly financial report. "I just returned to the country. My parents want me to get married as soon as possible. In their eyes, a married man means stability. And only a stable man can inherit the family  business."


I fell silent.


Two days ago, I vowed I'd bring home someone better than Rhys.

Someone impressive enough to silence my parents.

Now, the universe had sent an answer-just with a thick layer of irony.

But I knew.

Marriage shouldn't be like this.

I'd already lived through a loveless engagement once.

All it left was a house full of silence, hollow intimacy,and a slow, brutalerosion of my self-respect.

I opened my mouth to say no.

But at that moment, my phone rang.

The sharp ringtone cut through the quiet like a knife.

I glanced at the screen-and felt like a bomb had exploded in my chest.

Caroline Vance.


My mother.

Catherine was back.

She must have called to announce something important.




I looked at that face-familiar yet distant-then back down at my phone.

And finally, I said the words:
can't accept."

I walked out of the hotel suite, the ringtone still shrieking behind me.

I answered, not because I wanted to, but because l needed-desperately-to sever the tie that kept dragging me back into the past.

"Why didn't you pick up your phone? Were you trying to give me a heart attack?"

My mother's voice came rapid-fire, like machine-gun fire.


"| thought you were dead in a ditch or kidnapped by some maniac! Get home. Now. We need to talk."


"I'm already on my way," I said coldly, hanging up before she could start round two.


I gave the driver my parents' address and collapsed into the backseat, like someone bracing for a colonoscopy without anesthesia.

Okay. Let's get this over with.

My neighbor-aka my one-night stand-was probably insane.

But while I still had a drop of alcohol-induced courage left in my blood-while the old Mira, desperate for love,hadn't crept back in-I had to move fast.

I had to throw this ruined mess back in their perfect little faces.


The Vance family estate sat in the kind of suburban enclave that didn't welcome anyone who couldn't afford a BMW. No subway stops. No bus routes. Just an elegantly worded "keep out,poor people."

At the wrought-iron gate, I took a deep breath. I felt like a boxer entering the ring. Shoulders squared. Chin up. Emotional armor locked in place.

The moment I entered the living room,I could sense the ambush.


My father-Franklin Vance-sat alone in his leather chair, wearing the same expression he probably used to fire underperforming hedge fund managers.

Beside him,my mother,Caroline,with her perfect hair and perfectly aligned pearl necklace, smiled the way a doctor does when saying, "The cancer's spread."

To their left, Rhys sat on the sofa, all solemn and brooding, as if waiting for a divorce lawyer to direct his next pose.


And on the right?

Catherine,obviously.

All we were missing was a gavel and a court reporter.

This was a trial.

I was the defendant.

And the verdict had already been written.

Mother struck first,


"What took you so long? I called you hours ago."

She crossed her arms, her tone colder than the AC.

"Traffic," |lied.
If I told them I'd just escaped from a man in a towel,they'd have me hospitalized.

"So? Why am I here?" My tone was sharp, iced over.

No one answered.

Not until Rhys stood, a bandage still across his forehead.

The sight of him looking vaguely wounded brought me a small,grim satisfaction.

"You left this at my place," he said slowly, holding something in his hand.

"Your bear alarm clock."

I stared at it.

A cheap, scuffed electronic clock shaped like a cartoon bear,its plastic face scratched and faded from over a decade of use.

And now, this relic was their opening move?

Rage rose in my throat, but I swallowed it.

"Thanks," I said flatly. "That's... thoughtful."

I snatched up the ridiculous little clock and turned to leave.

Come on. No one calls a full-blown family meeting just to return an alarm clock. I knew better. This was about humiliation. About putting me in my place.

They were the real family.

I was always the outsider-invited in only when they needed a benchwarmer.
"Wait," my mother said, her voice even colder than before.


I paused. Didn't turn around.

She folded her arms again and smiled-a tight,poisonous smile you only see when a doctor says "Stage four."

"Now that Catherine's back," she said, "and since you and Rhys have broken up, we believe it's time-he and Catherine should be engaged."

I gave a short, humorless laugh. Turned around slowly,letting the sarcasm drip from my lips.

"By all means. Plan whatever you want. It's not like you've ever asked for my opinion before."

"We used to ask," she shot back, her voice sharp,"back when you were still the sensible daughter. The one with potential."

She stepped closer.

"You're too emotional, Mira. Your insecurity made you paranoid-accusing Rhys, trying to control him. You didn't trust him, and that's what destroyed the relationship."

Her words were blades.


Light in tone.

Ruthless in effect.


"So this is on you.

And you'll make that clear in the press.
Tell them you fell for someone else.

That's why you ended the engagement."

I froze.

Something ripped open inside my chest-like they'd torn it apart with their bare hands.

I looked at them-all of them-my parents, Rhys,Catherine.




So calm. So deliberate.


Like a script they'd rehearsed for weeks.

What had I done to deserve this?

Where had I gone so wrong?

I was ready to explode. To storm out.

But that's when my father finally stood.

Like a judge preparing to read the sentence.

"You don't have to worry about finding someone new,"he said with absolute finality

"We've already made arrangements-"
###Chapter 6 Family Showdown

I didn't even remember how I got out of that house.

All I had was one single, sharp conclusion echoing through my head-

I must not be their daughter.

And I had to find out the truth.

It was the only explanation I could cling to-because otherwise,how could I live with the idea that my own parents were capable of being this cruel?

The moment I got back to my apartment,I collapsed into bed. I didn't move until my phone started ringing.


It was Yvaine.


I didn't wait for her to ask anything-l just blurted out everything my parents had done.

And,yes... I also told her about the one-night stand.

I left out the proposal.

Yvaine let out a scream so high-pitched it could probably shatter glass and kill all the plants in my apartment.

"You had a one-night stand?! And you didn't FaceTime me live from the scene?!"


I switched the phone to speakerand tossed it onto the couch,slumping back into the cushions with my eyes closed.

Her voice kept going like fireworks:

"Who is he? What mythological realm did this man come from? Are you telling me you actually, finally let Rhys go? Don't tell me-he looks like Michelangelo carved him, or..."

She paused. I could picture her sitting up on her sofa,wrapped in a blanket, making that infamous,exaggerated gesture.

"A wand of unnatural proportions?"

"You are-so. Incredibly. Annoying," I groaned,dragging a pillow over my face.

"You're dodging the topic," she snapped back instantly.




Yes.


Yes,I was.

I never hid things from Yvaine. Not even the ugliest parts of my story.

Not even... last night.

I slept with a man whose last name I couldn't remember.


Just to peel Rhys's residue off my skin-for a minute,an hour, a night-whatever it took to feel free again.

Was it liberating?


No.
It was revenge, escape, and a cocktail of both with a guilt chaser.

But Yvaine wasn't here to judge me.

She was here to douse the flames-even if it was only through the tiny speaker in my living room.

"At least tell me this," she said suddenly, her voice lowering,softer. "Was he hot? Like, close-your-eyes -and-you-can-still-see-his-brow-bone hot?"

"...Hot," I muttered into the pillow.

"And when he touched you... did it feel like he knew you were something rare? Like you were a limited edition made just for him?"

I clenched my jaw. Didn't answer.

"Oh my god," she breathed.

"You actually slept with someone who was worth it."

I kept my eyes closed, and for some reason,that one sentence felt like a suture pulled gently over the tear in my chest.

My parents' voices still echoed in my head-sharp,suffocating, like burnt toast you couldn't scrape off.

The way they'd discarded me-so clinical, so composed. Like tossing out a baby bottle that had outlived its use.


"Mira," her voice shifted again, quieter, steadier. "You can do anything. Screw up, break down, love the wrong person-it's all fine. But you can't carry all of this alone anymore."

 I said nothing.

Just pulled my knees to my chest and pressed my face into them.




"I'm here," she whispered. "Wherever you go Whatever you do. I'm here."





1 didn't cry.


I swear | didn't.


I just clenched my jaw, shut my eyes tighter, and swallowed the words thank you like a pill I couldn't quite get down.

I glanced at the time.


I had to go to work.


Now that my parents had made it clear | was disposable, my job was the one thing I couldn't afford to screw up.

Of course,they believed I worked as a barista.


They'd forbidden me from having a corporate job.

In their minds, once married, I should be home full-time-a perfectlittle housewife.




So I never told them what I really did.


Dragging my exhausted body out the door, I headed to Ground & Pound-my workplace.




The name? Chosen because the owner figured it had no real brand potential. Was it a sexy coffee shop? An underground MMA gym? Who knew? Who cared?

But it was decent.
Stable.

And for now-safe.

Well... until it no longer existed

"Mira."


My boss, Benny, greeted me like I was his parole officer-nervous, sweaty, probably two seconds away from peeing his pants.

He was in his forties, wore a man bun that did no favors for his hairline, and his arms were covered in tattoos best described as regrettable-one of which featured a goat wearing sunglasses.

"You don't need to be here today. I was just about to call you..." He stared at the floor. "You're not on the schedule anymore."

Excuse me?

"You've been... let go. I'm really sorry. I didn't want to,but... I got a call. From your mom."

My stomach dropped.

"She threatened to report us, said she'd have our license revoked if I didn't fire you." Benny kept staring at the floor. "I'm sorry. I couldn't do anything."

"She runs a luxury skincare company, Benny. Not the goddamn FBI."

He shrugged helplessly. "She said she'd report us for health code violations. And you know she's got connections. She could actually pull it off."
I took a deep breath. Yelling at Benny wouldn't do anything. This wasn't his fault.

Before I did something stupid-like hurling a milk jug out the window-I stormed out.


I didn't hate that job. Being a barista was just a side hustle.


What really paid the bills-what no one knew except Yvaine-was my jewelry design.

Ever since | was a kid, my mom had told me I was average. Ordinary. Talentless. Every time I tried to shine, she dragged me back into her shadow.

Eventually, I learned to obey. I buried my ambition,wore gray feathers like a peacock pretending to be a pigeon.

So no, I didn't care about losing the coffee shop job.

What infuriated me wasn't unemployment. It was that this-this powNer move-was her.

Her fingerprints were all over it.

It was her punishment. A response to me trying to escape Rhys. Trying to escape her.

She was sending me a message:

You don't get to walk away.

I can destroy any scrap of pride you think you've earned-with one finger.

If she thought I would come crawling back, like | used to,begging for her approval..
 She could go to hell.

I wasn't her puppet anymore.

I was done playing the good girl.

Thirty minutes later, I shoved open the front door of the Vance estate.

No knocking. I didn't care.

I had come ready to start round two of our family war.

What I found instead was something far worse.

My parents were sitting on the ivory couch in the living room,sipping wine worth more than my rent, laughing -Laughing-with a man I didn't recognize.

The scene was picturesque. Like they'd stepped rght out of How to Host the Perfect Suburban Power Dinner.


The man looked like a slimy, watered-down version of a 1950s mogul-maybe one who'd spent time in white-collar prison and came out with a tailor.

Custom suit. Shirt unbuttoned to mid-chest, revealing a patch of chest hair that looked like someone had just trimmed a Christmas wreath.

His teeth were too white, his smile too polished-like greed dipped in varnish.

"Darling," my mother cooed, sweet as syrup,ome meet Mr. Leonard Shaw, CEO of Alcott Shipping. A true self-made man. There's so much you could learn from him-about turning raw talent into real success."
 It hit like a scented hammer to the face.

Leonard grinned ear to ear. His eyes-no,his eyes went straight under my skirt.

"Lovely to meet you, Miss Vance," he said. "I do hope we get to talk more. I always enjoy mentoring young women. Especially smart,beautiful ones like yourself."

I didn't bother hiding my expression.

It wasn't disgust. It was nausea.

He was practically licking his lips.

I could hear the soundtrack of Indecent Proposal playing in his head.

"Mira," my mother warned in that sugar-coated threat tone, "don't be rude. Shake Mr. Shaw's hand."

I didn't move. I didn't even blink.

If someone had thrown a raccoon at me in that moment, I'd have hugged it over touching Leonard's hand.


Caroline's laugh rang out, high and brittle, like she was trying to cover up my resistance.

"Young people are so sensitive these days, aren't they?"she said to Leonard, with the practiced tone of someone saying she'll come around.

Leonard just waved it off. "I like a girl with a little fire."

Yeah, and I like dentists who don't need pliers. We can't all get what we want.

And my father-the same man who, justdays ago,told me 'we'll take care of everything'-was now nodding at Leonard like a hotel concierge hoping for a good tip.

That's when I understood.

This wasn't an introduction.

It was a presentation.

I was the product on display tonight.

This wasn't about meeting a 'promising single man.'

This was a sale. I was being marketed like a financial package with a bonus gift.

When Leonard finally left-leaving behind a cloud of cologne and a trail of sleaze-l turned to face them.

"What the hell was that?"

My mother raised her wine glass, took a slow.triumphant sip.

"That," she said with a smnile,"was your future husband."
###Chapter 7Threats
I blinked. Then snorted. "You've officially lost the plot.You're pimping me out to a man who probably gets the senior citizen discount."


"Don't be dramatic," Mum snapped, though her voice remained polished and posh. "If you won't marry Rhys,you'll have to marry someone. You don't get to float around like some spoiled socialite with no value.That's not how this works."


I stared at her. "So, this is it? I dump Rhys and suddenly you're throwing me at the next billionaire with a functioning heart valve?"

Mum pursed her lips as if trying not to roll her eyes."I was furious when I heard about the state of your relationship with Rhys. Especially your attitude yesterday. You were cold. Rude. Disrespectful. You embarrassed me. But as it turns out, the situation can still be salvaged."

"Right, because now that your precious Catherine's back in Skyline City, suddenly it's 'convenient' I'm out of the way," I said, unable to keep the bitterness from slipping out.

Mum didn't even blink. "It is convenient. Rhys and Catherine have history. They're better suited."
"So I did you a favor then."

"You didn't do me a favor," she snapped. "You created a mess. Without Catherine's timely return, what you did could have seriously offended the Grangers. Do you have any idea how valuable that connection is?You don't want Rhys? Fine. But you're going to make it right by finding another match-and soon."

"No,"I said flatly.

Mum leaned forward, that terrifying stillness settling over her face-the kind that always came right before she did something diabolical. "I invested a fortune raising you. Education. Clothes. Debutante nonsense.Do you think that was free? You've done nothing for the family,Mirabelle. At the very least, you owe us a strategic alliance. It's the least you can do."

| scoffed. "Send me an invoice then. I'll pay back whatever little expense I cost you. But I'm not selling myself to the highest bidder just so you can recoup your 'investment'."

Throughout the mother-daughter debate, Frank-darling Daddy-just sat there. Silent. Supportive in the way that meant "I'll let your mother destroy you and offer you a biscuit afterwards."

I turned to Mum again. "That wasn't why I came back Why the hell did you call my boss? You got me fired."

"That was the price of disobedience," she said coolly."You don't get to disrespect me and walk away unscathed. And Rhys deserved better than your tantrum yesterday. You embarrassed all of us. You should be thinking about how to make things right instead of behaving like a brat. I suggest you start by making a date with Leonard Shaw."

I clenched my fists. "I'm never marrying Shaw. Or any other sleazebag you dig up from your Rolodex of corporate creeps."

Mum was utterly unfazed. "You'll fall in line. You always do."

"You've already cost me my job. I don't even live at home anymore. There's nothing else you can take from me."


Her smile was slow. Cold. "Don't be so sure. I can do plenty. You like your apartment, don't you? Shame if your landlord suddenly decided your lease was void."

My stomach dropped.

"And that best friend of yours... what's her name?Yvaine? Her parents' little family business still depends on our supplier network. That could change.Fast."


I stared at her, stunned. "You wouldn't."

"Would you be willing to risk it?"

The way she said it, I knew-without a shred of doubt -that she meant every vile syllable.

Caroline Vance didn't run a Fortune 500 company, but she did run my father like a high-end Roomba, and Daddy dearest was neck-deep in Skyline City's  business scene. If she wanted to destroy someone's livelihood, all she had to do was give the word.

I didn't have a choice. Not really. I couldn't let Yvaine get caught in the crossfire of my family's twisted drama. If someone had to go down, it wasn't going to be her.


So I went on the offensive.


"I can't marry Shaw, because I'm already engaged,"I said,with the conviction of someone who absolutely wasn't but desperately needed to be.

Mum actually blinked. "You're what?"

"Engaged," I repeated,casually inspecting my nails like I wasn't making this up on the spot. "Met someone incredible. Very powerful. We're getting married."

Dad gave a little cough, as if he'd just woken from a nap."That's not possible. You were engaged to Rhys for years. You broke it off last week."

"Well, it's been a productive week," I said, flashing my most deranged pageant smile. "Turns out, I rebound very well."

Mum narrowed her eyes. "Who is he?"

"You'll meet him soon enough," I said, lifting my bag and stepping toward the door. "I'll bring him home for dinner sometime. And I promise, he'll make your Leonard Shaw look like a budget haircut in a back-alley barbershop."

"Mirabelle-"
 I left before she could start interrogating me.

Back at my flat, I flopped onto the sofa like a collapsing deck chair andgroaned.

I was furious. Not just at Mum-though her high-handed,Machiavellian meddling had definitely earned her a porime spot on my personal hit list-but at myself.Because after all these years of therapy, wine, and telling myself I was immune to her manipulations...she still got under my skin like glitter in a carpet.

And now I'd gone and thrown a bloody fiancé into the mix like I was auditioning for a Hallmark Christmas special, minus the snow, the charm, or the actual fiancé. The woman would suss me out in three business days, max. Probably sooner if she skipped brunch.


I needed to make my little lie true. Somehow. I needed a man who oozed enough wealth and power to make my mum clutch her pearls and my dad reach for his investment portfolio. Someone untouchable.Impressive. Preferably with enough bite to make them both second-guess every smug word out of their mouths.


Too bad every eligible guy I knew who fit the bill was either married, morally bankrupt, or part of Rhys's polo -playing inner circle.

"Shit," I muttered, burying my face in a throw pillow.

Then, just as I was ready to spiral into a full-blown panic, a face floated into my mind.
###Chapter 8 Let's Make a Deal
I stopped outside his door, took a deep breath like l was about to skydive without a parachute, and knocked.


No going back now. Not unless I fancied throwing myself down the stairwell.

The door swung open almost immediately, leaving me zero time to panic or bolt.

There he was-in a suit. A proper one. Not the kind you wear for a Zoom meeting or to make your ex jealous on Instagram, but the sort that whispered "money"and "I don't queue for anything, ever."

He looked like he was on his way out.

Maybe a date.

Probably with someone tall, elegant, and dangerously immune to carbs.

Regret made a swift U-turn in my gut, and I took atiny step back, already rethinking everything.

But then he gestured for me to wait. He was on the phone, looking very much like a man who closed deals before breakfast. He held up a hand,mouthed "one second," then pointed inside.

I stepped into his flat, trying not to look too nosy while absolutely snooping.

It was about the same size and layout as mine, but the vibe was all different.


Where mine screamed "early-twenties chaos with a side of IKEA regrets," his felt sleek. Understated.Expensive in that annoying way where you knew each item had a brand name that required a six-month waitlist and a blood oath.

Still, it didn't feel lived-in. No clutter, no mess, no personality. More hotel suite than home.

Either he'd just moved in like I suspected, or he barely slept here. Which, fair enough. He didn't look like the type who needed more than four hours of sleep or any kind of throw cushion.

Before I could finish my impromptu Cribs tour, he ended the call and turned to me, eyebrow raised in question.

Right. Time to stop gawping.

I pulled out the cheque I'd written and held it out.

"For the shirt," I said. "The one I sort of shredded during our, uh, you know... last time."

He looked at the cheque. "I don't need it."

"I know. But I do. Need to give it, I mean." I set it on his glass coffee table.

He didn't reply. And I suddenly had absolutely no idea what to do with my limbs. My arms were weird. My legs were traitors. The silence swelled between us like a balloon full of awkward.


Then he moved closer.

Just a step. Barely even that. But it was enough.

"What's the real reason you came?"

I froze. Every muscle in my body tensed.

Being this close, I was forcibly reminded of just how tall he was-and how much he radiated that very specific, very male sort of danger. That raw, unfiltered,primal energy that made my instincts twitch like I was standing in front of something wild and untamed.

He wasn't doing anything. Just leaning in, breathing the same air. But my pulse was suddenly doing parkour in my neck and my mouth was dry.

It wasn't fear, not exactly. It was that same instinctual thrill you'd get if you were face to face with a leopard in the wild-well-fed, maybe, but still looking at you like it hadn't ruled out dessert.


Even if there was glass between you and the claws,your body still clocked that you were in the presence of a predator.

My palms were sweating. My knees had opinions about gravity. My fight-or-flight response was going through a full-blown crisis.

All because this man, this maybe-dangerous, possibly -rich, definitely-hot neighbour was looking at me.

And here I was about to pitch the world's most deranged idea: fake marriage. Casual pretend engagement.

Just your everyday "hey, can you be my incredibly powerful and slightly terrifying fiancé so my parents will stop trying to marry me off to the highest.bidder?"

Yeah. No way this was going to come across as anything but completely unhinged.

To stall, I said, "You mentioned a proposal that time..back at the hotel? I didn't really catch the details."

He raised an eyebrow. "That's funny. Because | seem to remember I'm the one asking the questions right now,and you still haven't answered me."

Right. That.

My mouth opened, and before | could stop myself, the words just... spilled out. "I want to marry you."

There was a beat of silence. Then he blinked.

"I mean-not really marry you," I added in a rush, the dam well and truly broken now. "I mean yes,technically, but not romantically. It's fake. A cover. A bluff. A strategic performance. My parents-okay, my mum-has basically gone full villain mode and is trying to auction me off to some obscenely wealthy fifty-year-old who owns, like, half the shipping industry and is on the hunt for Wife Number Five, and if I don't show up with someone even richer and more terrifying,she's going to force me into some grotesque merger of souls and assets. I've got three days to conjure up a billionaire fiancé with serious scary-man energy,and the list of available candidates is currently: you."
 I finally paused to breathe, chest heaving like I'd just finished a sprint, which, emotionally speaking, I had.

He didn't say anything. Didn't laugh. Didn't call building security. Just studied me for a second like. I was a crossword puzzle that had started solving itself.

And then he nodded.


"Alright," he said.

I blinked at him. "Sorry-what?"

"Okay," he repeated, like this sort of thing happened to him all the time. "I'll do it."


I stared. My brain short-circuited so hard I half expected to smell burnt toast. "Just like that?"

He shrugged. "My family's been on my back about finding a wife. I'm not interested in dating. Your proposal happens to solve my problem too."

Oh.

He went on, "In fact, that was what I was trying to bring up back at the hotel, before you left."

I was speechless.

"l-this feels... surreal," I said, blinking at him like he'd grown another head. "I mean, me needing a fake fiancé at the exact same time you're in the market for a fake fiancée? What are the odds-? Wait, just to be clear," I added hastily, "it is a fake fiancée you are looking for, right? Not a real one, I mean."
 ###Chapter 9 Fake Engagement
"Fake, of course." I caught the faintest trace of a smile as he answered. "And arranged partnerships for mutual benefit happen more often than you think.We're just skipping the dinner dates and going straight to the paperwork."

Then he gestured for me to sit down, pulled out a sleek black notebook, and began listing terms. Like this was a bloody,client meeting.

I sat through the whole thing in a fog, nodding along as we discussed timelines, appearances, and what counted as acceptable hand-holding.

At one point, he used the phrase 'public intimacy quotient,' and I had to fight the urge to check if this was all some elaborate prank being livestreamed on TikTok.


Even after we shook on it, I still felt like I'd slipped into an alternate reality where men agreed to fake marriages without blinking, and I somehow wasn't being scammed.

"There's a party in three days," he said casually, like it was no big deal. "I'll need you there. It's time to announce our engagement."

He paused, looking at me with that same predatory "And I'll do the same for you, with your family. Let's give them a show they won't forget."

***


I left his apartment in a daze, drifted back to mine like I'd just been abducted by aliens and dropped back on Earth without the instruction manual.

Even when I slid into a booth across from Yvaine at our usual dinner spot, I stilI felt like I'd accidentally wandered out of my own body and into someone else's wildly overdramatic Netflix show.

"Hello? Earth to Mira." Yvaine waved her hand in front of my face. "You look like someone just told you your flat's been repossessed by a cult."

I blinked myself back to consciousness and gave her the rundown: getting fired from the coffeehouse,my mother's role in it, the continued repercussions of cutting ties with Rhys-everything.

Yvaine's face scrunched up as if she'd just tasted battery acid. She let out a string of expletives sO colorful it could've qualified as abstract art, most of them directed at my mother. I politely ignored the part where she called Caroline a 'fire-breathing dementor in a Chanel suit.'

"That's not why I called you," I said, waving away the job thing. "You know I couldn't care less about the barista job. I mean, yes, RIP to my 40% staff discount,but that's where the mourning ends."
"Still," Yvaine huffed,"'that's no excuse for what Caroline pulled. I mean, does she wake up and choose villainy every morning or is it a spontaneous thing?"

Before she could continue her spirited campaign to have my mother tried for emotional war crimes, I hit her with the real headline.

"I've, uh... sort of gotten engaged."

Yvaine froze mid-sip. Her eyes went so wide | was half-worried they'd roll right out of her head and into her cappuccino.

"Don't tell me you've gone back to Rhys."

"God, no." I made a face like she'd just suggested l marry my cousin. "This is worse. Or better? I don't even know anymore."

I launched into the full saga: my mother trying to auction me off to Skyline City's edition of Daddy Warbucks, my desperate bluff about already having a more powerful fiancé, and how I somehow ended up convincing my absurdly hot neighbor-who also happened to be my rebound one-night stand-to go along with the madness.

Yvaine didn't interrupt once. Her eyes just kept getting bigger until I was convinced she was morphing into a human bush baby.

"Right," she finally said, after a long pause and possibly some internal screaming. "Now I'm dying to meet this mystery man."
"You will. There's a party in three days. He wants to make the engagement public. You know, the usual fake fiancé PR package. I've got you an invite."

Yvaine nodded slowly, as if her brain was still buffering.Then she raised her coffee mug. "I suppose this calls for a celebration."


"It's a fake engagement."

"Yes, but no one else knows that, do they? Besides, I'm not celebrating that. I'm celebrating the fact that you've finally told Caroline where to shove it. And that you're officially free from Rhys, the walking red flag."

I clinked my mug'against hers. "I'll drink to that."

And we did. Then we smiled at each other. Yvaine had this uncanny talent for turning total chaos into a party theme. With her around, even my absolute train wreck of a life felt kind of... fun.

"This calls for wine, not caffeine," she declared,snapping her fingers at a passing waiter. "Bring us the wine list!"


It was shaping up to be a properly celebratory afternoon.

Right up until Rhys waltzed into the same bloody restaurant.

With Catherine hanging off his arm like a Dior handbag.

She swanned over to our table, gave us this wide-eyed look of manufactured surprise, and said, "Oh!
Mira? I didn't expect to see you here."

Before I could say anything remotely scathing, she leaned in just enough to seem intimate and murmured,"Mum mentioned you're seeing someone now...an older gentleman, wasn't it? Mr. Shaw, I think?"

She said it casually, but her eyes flicked to Rhys, like she wanted to make sure he was catching every word.

Then came the sigh, soft, almost regretful. "I believe he's been through, what... four divorces?"

She let that hang in the air just long enough to stíng,then added, with this serene, saintly little smile, "But of course, to each their own."

Her tone was all indulgent big sister, the kind who wouldn't dream of judging your choices out loud-though she was clearly dying to hand you a pamphlet titled Why You're Doing It All Wrong.

Rhys's expression shifted like someone had just told him his stocks had tanked. He looked straight at me,eyes all moody and brooding, and demanded, 'So this is why you ended the engagement?'

I briefly considered baptizing them both in merlot,but this place was far too classy for that kind of scene.Also, I really didn't want to end up on a viral TikTok titled 'Local Woman Loses It in Midtown Bistro.'


Yvaine crossed her arms, eyes blazing, and sneered at Rhys as if she was seconds away from launching her drink at his face. "You of all damn people know exactly why Mira ended the engagement. Don't you dare stand there and play the victim you're not fooling anyone."

She gave him a disappointed look. "You know, I used to think you were better than this. Turns out I was giving you way too much credit."

Then she tilted her chin towards Catherine with a cold little smirk. "You two really are a perfect match. Trash finds trash, after all."

Rhys's face went redder than the merlot in my glass."Say that again and your modeling career's over."

That's when I'd had enough.
###Chapter 10Evicted
"Shut it, Rhys," I snapped. "You know damn well why I broke things off. So do us all a favor and back off."

He noticed the death grip I had on the wine bottle and caught the look in my eyes-the same look that said l wouldn't think twice about smashing it over his infuriating head again, just like last time.

Rhys froze. The look on his face was absolutely priceless. It was like I'd just walked up and slapped him with a frozen salmon.


He simply couldn't process the fact that I was no longer the starry-eyed doormat who used to treat his words like gospel. Hewas probably still reeling from the time I'd literally slapped him during our breakup.

Honestly, I didn't think his ego had recovered.

Before Rhys could open his mouth again, a manager in a suit so sharp it could've sliced air walked over. He looked at Rhys and Catherine as if they were yesterday's expired prawns.

"Sir, ma'am, I'm afraid you're now on our banned list.You're no longer welcome here. Ever."

Rhys spluttered like a clogged kettle."W-what? You can't be serious."
 Instead of explaining, the manager waved over security. Two very large men in very small earpieces started making their way toward our table.

Rhys kept yelling something about how he'd "file a complaint" or whatever nonsense billionaires shout when things don't go their way.

Catherine just hissed something under her breath and followed him out, her heels clicking likeangry punctuation marks.

Once the chaos walked itself out, the manager turned to me with a faint, polite smile. "Apologies for the disturbance, miss. Your dinner tonight is on the house."

I blinked at him. "That's... very generous of you."

"My pleasure," he said smoothly. "You're a highly valued patron here at La Vache Dorée."

"Highly valued." Right. I'd been here maybe twice this past month, and both times I'd ordered the cheapest set menu and split a dessert with Yvaine.

I eyed the manager, whom I'd vaguely recognized from those visits-always polite, always professional,but never this... chummy. He gave off big energy of someone who wouldn't notice me in a line-up unless I'd set the restaurant on fire.

Before I could question his sudden generosity, he handed me a black card embossed with the restaurant's logo.
 
"The owner asked me to pass this along. You're welcome to dine here anytime. No charge."

He gave me a little bow and disappeared into the kitchen before | could even sputter a refusal.

Yvaine gawked at the card. "Wait, what? Mira, do you know the owner of this place?"

I shook my head. "No."

But I had a hunch who it might be.

***


When I got back to my flat, still riding the high from watching Rhys and Catherine get chucked out of the restaurant like a couple of misbehaving toddlers, the universe decided I'd had enough fun for the night.

My Landlord was waiting by my door, fiddling with his keys like they were rosary beads. Mr. Donnelly, mid-fifties,who always smelled faintly of microwaveable shepherd's pie and wore socks with sandals, gave me a look like I'd just run over his cat.


"Miss Vance, I'm really sorry," he said, scratching his head in that way men do when they're about to say something completely awful but want to look sympathetic while doing it. "There's going to be some,ah,urgent renovations. Safety stuff. You'll need to, ah,vacate the apartment by the end of the week."

Right. And I was the Queen of England.

I could practically hear my mother's voice behind his.

Guess she'd made good on that charming threat.

I nodded. "I'll be gone in two days."
 No arguments. No begging.

No point.

He gave an awkward nod and shuffled off, probably to microwave another shepherd's pie.

I'd expected this. Just didn't expect my mother to move this fast.

Moving wasn't an issue. I could afford somewhere better. Bigger. With windows that didn't jam and a kitchen that didn't double as a sauna every time l boiled water.

Hell, I could've offered Mr. Donnelly double the rent and he'd probably have wept with joy and accepted.

But that would've been like duct-taping a crack in the Hoover Dam.

Even if I stayed, my mum knew where I lived. The calls,the visits, the threats disguised as motherly concern-none of it would stop unless I gave in and married Leonard Shaw or whatever crusty aristocrat she dug up,or found a man powerful enough to scare her into silence.


Speaking of which...

I was halfway through mentally packing my jewellery tools and wondering if my next landlord would let me solder in the living room when it hit me-l'd agreed to fake an engagement with my very attractive neighbor,and I didn't even know his bloody name.

Brilliant.
In my defense, I'd been a little preoccupied during that meeting,mostly with the way his shirt hugged his shoulders.

And also with the very inconvenient, very vivid flashbacks to that night in the hotel room. The one with all the foggy bits and the completely uncalled-for heat.

So when he started going on about the details of our arrangement, I was too busy staring at his mouth and wondering if it still tasted the same to take in much of anything else.

Still. Minor detail.

I scribbled a note!

Hey, just a heads-up-I'm moving out in two days.Long story. Here's my number in case you still want to go ahead with the whole fake fiancé thing. Name's Mira,by the way. Cheers.

I tucked it under his door across the hall. The lights were off, no sound from inside.

He was probably out doing hot, mysterious things.Like brooding on a rooftop or teaching orphans how to box or whatever handsome men do when they're not accidentally getting roped into fake relationships.

Then I went back to my flat, plonked myself on the sofa, opened my laptop, and typed "apartments that won't ruin your life" into the search bar.

Rhys rang just as I was elbow-deep in a bag of cheesy crisps, trying to ignore my tragic life by watching an aggressively cheerful baking show.

I answered because | was in a good mood and didn't bother to check caller ID.


Stupid of me,really.

He didn't bother with small talk. "Dinner. Tomorrow night. With my family."

I leaned back on the sofa and stared at the ceiling like it owed me an explanation. "Rhys, we're not together anymore. In case your memory's as selective as your morals." 1

He huffed. "My mother wants to see you."
###Chapter 11Blackout
That stopped me. Just for a second.

Louisa Granger. The only member of that genetically cursed family I'd actually liked.

She used to call me her "darling girl," and she meant it. She remembered my birthday. She bought me books I actually read. She once told me l had a fire in me and that it was beautiful.

Meanwhile, my own mother thought my jewelry designs were a hobby l'd grow out of, and that fire belonged in fireplaces or hell.

"Come to dinner," Rhys carried on, his tone clipped."Just don't say anything to her about...you know. Us."Of course he wanted me to lie for him. Again.

"Wow. Brave of you," I said, my voice sharp enough to julienne a zucchini. "What happened to that big manly energy you were showing off with Catherine? If you're so smitten, why not bring her to dinner and introduce her to the fam? Or are you worried Mummy might not approve of your shiny new mistress?"

He didn't reply. I didn't wait for him to.

I hung up, tossed my phone on the sofa,and muttered,"Bloody coward."
Half past ten. I'd just put down the TV remote and dug out an unfinished sketch from my tablet, thinking l could snack my way into some inspiration.

I barely got two bites of leftover lo mein before the lights cut outlike a budget horror film. One second I was basking in LED brilliance, the next I was plunged into darkness, lit only by the ghostly glow of my tablet screen.


I practically launched myself off the sofa. My heart did a triple backflip before I realized it was just a blackout Again. Because of course this floor had the electrical stability of a soggy biscuit.

I fumbled for my phone and rang Mr. Donnelly. No answer. I called again. Still nothing. Classic Donnelly-less "property manager," more"professional ghoster."

I wouldn't have put it past him to fake a blackout just to speed up my moving out.

I'd already said I was leaving. Did he really need to go full supervillain with the power supply?

No wonder this place was cheap. Faulty wiring and a landlord who disappeared faster than my willpower around cake. Still, for rent that low, I couldn't stay mad for long.

Besides, I was out of here soon enough.

Grumbling under my breath, I groped my way into the stairwell to check the fuse box. Of course,it was at a height best suited for NBA players

I'm nearly 5'7" and had to stand on tiptoe like | was doing pirouettes in the dark-only with more swearing and less grace.

Not that it helped. I stared at the jumble of switches like it was written in hieroglyphics.

"Bloody hell," I muttered, returning to fetch a chair before I electrocuted myself out of sheer guesswork.Just as I reached my door, the neighbor's door eased open.

And there he was.

Like me, he was using his phone as a torch, which gave me a clear view of his face. His fringe,usually styled like a GQ cover shoot, was loose and damp, making him look about five years younger and way too good -looking for the average tenant.

Droplets slid from his hair down his neck, over his collarbone, down over muscles that really needed a warning label.

The man had on nothing but a towel.

Just.A. Towel.


And judging by the little rivers of water tracing down his torso, he'd rushed out of the shower to investigate the blackout without bothering with trivial things like clothes.

I tried very hard not to ogle


| failed spectacularly To be fair, it was like being hit in the face with a very well-sculpted Greek statue.

A very wet,half-naked, annoyingly sexy Greek statue.

Last time I saw him, he'd been dressed to the nines in a tailored suit. I hadn't expected him to be this...stacked.

It was like finding out your accountant moonlighted as a Calvin Klein model.

My brain short-circuited for a moment. I just stood there, blatantly gawking like some creep on a stag do.

He caught me staring. Of course he did. His eyes-partly hidden under a mess of damp fringe-crinkled ever so slightly.

Then he glanced at my ears, probably noticing that they were turning the same color as a cherry slushie,and finally turned back inside.

He came back a minute later wearing a white T-shirt.

I blinked and cleared my throat.

Now that he was fully clothed-or at least pretending to be-the tension eased a bit and my brain came back online.


I launched into an explanation about the blackout and the fuse box situation. "Sorry to bother you. I didn't expect the power to go out at this time of night, and the landlord's decided to ghost me."

"It's no bother," he said in that deep,low voice that probably doubled as white noise for insomniacs. He brushed past me and headed to the fuse box. He didn't even have to stretch. Where I'd nearly dislocated my toes trying to reach it, he just flicked the switches like he was turning on a light in a fridge.

Must be nice, being tall and useful.

He squinted at the fuse box for a moment, flicked another switch, then muttered, "Looks like the main breaker's loose. Might've been knocked about-cheap casing, maybe. I'll see if I can tighten it up."

"Oh, okay," I said, nodding along like I was following,even though my brain had already checked out of the electrical conversation and checked into the gym that was his back.


The white cotton T-shirt clung to him in all the right places-or maybe it was just thin enough to show off everything he had going on underneath. Every time he moved, muscles shifted under the fabric like they were choreographing a silent dance routine.

It was hypnotic. Like watching bread rise. Or lava Lamps. But hotter.




I must have been staring at his back like a total weirdo for a full two minutes before | remembered | was supposed to be helping, not leering.

I cleared my throat. "If it's a hassle, don't worry about it. It's late anyway. I should probably just call the landlord in the morning."

Without turning around, he said, "There's a storage room near the stairs. Might be a pair of pliers in there.

 Grab them for me."
###Chapter 12Runaway Libido
The hallway outside was still pitch black, so l used my phone's torch to sweep the walls like I was on a ghost -hunting show.

Eventually, I found the storage room, which was basically a hoarder's fever dream. Tools, nails, screws,boxes-an entire DIY graveyard dumped in a single corner.

The pliers were buried somewhere in the back like they owed someone money.

I stretched up, teetering on my toes, reaching for them like I was auditioning for Swan Lake: Apocalypse Edition.

Just as I grabbed them, my foot rolled over something suspiciously round and untrustworthy.I yelped,lost my balance, and flailed like a human car dealership balloon mid-windstorm.

There were nails all over the floor. Actual nails. Pointy and plentiful. The sort of thing that would absolutely ruin my chances at open-toed heels ever again.

But the pain never came.

Instead, a pair of strong arms wrapped around my waist and hauled me upright like I weighed less than a bag of crisps.

"Careful," he muttered, his voice low.

My heart was still trying to yeet itself out of my chest.

I couldn't see him-he was behind me-but every one of my senses was dialed up to a hundred in the dark.

His breath skimmed my neck, warm and soft. The heat of his hands burned through the fabric of my top, his fingers firm against my waist like he was built to catch wayward women in stairwell accidents.

And his scent-Jesus. Freshly showered, with that crisp,clean smell of soap that definitely cost more than my weekly grocery shop. Something ridiculous, like "Alpine Seduction" or "Boardroom Temptation."

Whatever it was, it had no business being that sexy.

The second I felt steady again, I pulled away from his arms.


And then the lights flicked on.

I blinked twice and shuffled a few feet away, putting what I hoped was a respectable amount of space between us. "You fixed it?"

"Yeah," he said. "Go check your place. See if everything's back to normal."

"Right. Yeah. Cool." I tossed the pliers onto a nearby shelf and fled.


I bolted back to my flat like someone had lit a fire under me, and it wasn't until the door clicked shut behind me that I realized I hadn't thanked him.
Or asked if he'd seen my note.

Basic social stuff. Stuff I usually didn't mess up.


Normally, I wasn't like this. I wasn't the type to go all wobbly-kneed and tongue-tied because of one attractive guy.

But apparently, close physical proximity to this man short-circuited my entire personality. One minute was Mirabelle Vance, functional adult with working vocabulary, and the next I was a glitching mess who couldn't even make eye contact without overheating.

And really, how was I meant to stay composed?


He had been standing there in a damp towel and a clingy T-shirt so thin it might as well have come with a viewer discretion warning.


The man's presence didn't just affect me-it practically rewired my hormones.




I was genuinely impressed I'd managed to escape before he noticed how the heat of his skin had turned my spine to jelly, or how close I'd come to full-on swooning.


Me.Swooning.

Like some Regency heroine who'd misplaced her smelling salts.




I shook my head violently, trying to scrub the image of him from my brain.




Him in that towel. Drops of water trailing down his neck.
That scent-clean, crisp, outrageously masculine

"Pull yourself together, Mira." I softly banged my head against the door. "You're not a blushing virgin or a hormonal teenager. You've seen abs before. Hell,you've had abs before."

My phone buzzed. I checked it with dread

Not Rhys. Thank God.

Unknown number: Saw your note. Noted about the moving out. Do you need help finding a new place?I have some suggestions if you'd like. Name's Ashton,by the way. 2

Oh. So that's his name.

Social etiquette whispered that I should probably call him. Thank him for the blackout rescue.


Or, I didn't know, discuss the upcoming party where we were supposed to debut our fake engagement.

The fact that he'd texted meant he was awake.

And probably shirtless.

I stared at my phone,debating.

Going over there at this hour felt like tempting fate.

Or,more accurately, tempting myself to do something wildly inappropriate-like climb him like a tree and make very questionable choices.

I didn't trust my judgement. Late night was prime territory for reckless decisions and accidentally catching feelings.
Or feelings-adjacent hormones.

So instead, I sent back a safe, responsible message: Thanks for the offer, but I've got several places in mind already. Good night.

***


The night came with dreams so vividly R-rated, my therapist would probably need to show ID before l could legally describe them.

I woke up with a groan muffled into my pillow, my brain still stuck in the haze of sleep and scandalous fantasies.

And, of course, there he was-Ashton. Bloody Ashton.Ashton with the abs you could grate cheese on.Ashton with arms so sculpted they looked like they'd been Photoshopped by Zeus himself. Ashton with-

Right, no. Stop it, Mira. I mentally slapped my libido and told it to sit in the corner and think about what it had done.

I spent the morning apartment-hunting to distract myself and the afternoon sketching designs for a jewellery line that the studio might use in their next launch.

I ordered takeaway, stayed firmly indoors, and basically avoided all windows like I was in witness protection-because if I so much as glimpsed Hot Ashton again, there was a non-zero chance l'd combust on the spot or attempt to lick his abs.
 Rhys didn't call again to chase me down for the family dinner.

Either he'd finally grown a pair, or he'd managed to weasel his way out of it without me.

I wondered if he'd dragged Catherine back to meet the family, then rolled my eyes and dismissed it.

His mum, Louisa, had always had a personal vendetta against Catherine.

Something about her being too sharp, too slick, and too obviously after the Granger family fortune.

Louisa would probably combust if she knew Rhys and Catherine were rekindling their ex-from-hell flame.

Speak of the devil.

Louisa's name flashed across my phone screen.

I hadn't called her since the breakup. I'd needed a breather to sort through the emotional wreckage, but apparently my breather had expired.

I stared at the phone, weighing my options: keep pretending I'd moved to a remote island with no signal, or grow a spine and deal with it.
###Chapter 13 Crash
I answered the call.

"Louisa..." | sounded sheepish, even to myself.

I could ghost Rhys with no regrets, but Louisa was a different story. She'd always treated me like family-sometimes more than my actual family did-and I couldn't bring myself to be cruel to her.

If she was calling now, she probably already knew about the split. Either Rhys had miraculously grown a spine and told her, or he'd been his usual cowardly self and she'd sensed something was off.

"Mira." She cleared her throat like she was bracing herself. "I know Rhys has been a complete idiot,but you've been engaged for two years. The wedding's next month, sweetheart. This isn't the time to throw a tantrum."

So he did tell her. Color me shocked. Or maybe Catherine was the one who pushed him into it, like she did with everything else.

I didn't want to upset Louisa. I really didn't. But there were some hills a girl had to die on, and this particular hill had 'no to marrying a man who drools over his ex'spray-painted all over it.

"Louisa, I think you already know what went down between Rhys and Catherine," I said, my voice as even as I could manage. "They're perfect for each other.Honestly. He's always had a thing for her. It's best to let them get on with it."

"Mira, don't be like this. I know you love Rhys." HHer voice was soft, almost pleading. "I'll gve him a proper talking-to, get him to end things with... with that woman.Sweetie,I know you're hurting-"

That cracked something in me. Just a little.

I swallowed hard, eyes stinging.

I'd been braced for Louisa to tear me a new one-for ruining the Granger name, for embarrassing Rhys in front of Skyline City's upper crust, for not playing my part as the dutiful almost-daughter-in-law.

But instead of going full Cruella, she said I was hurting That she understood. And somehow, that made it worse.


I let out a long, tired sigh

This wasn't our first breakup rodeo. Back in the day whenever Rhys and I hit a rough patch, Louisa would swoop in with homemade cookies and guilt trips, and I'd melt faster than ice cream at a barbecue. I could never stay mad when she looked at me like I was already part of the family.

And maybe that's what made me stick it out with Rhys for so long. I wasn't just trying to make it work with him-I was trying to honor her.

But this time, I'd had enough of bending backward just to keep everyone else comfortable.

"Louisa, this isn't some one-off," I said, my voice steady even though my heart felt like it was chewing itself apart. "Rhys never really let go of Catherine.Not then, and not now. It's only gotten worse. I'm done pretending I'm okay with it."

There was a pause. Then her voice came back,thinner,raspier.




"Marriage isn't some joke, Mira. I've always seen you as my daughter-in-law. I mean that. I'll talk to Rhys. I will. I'll make sure he cuts ties with that woman. Please,darling, just give him one more chance. Even if it's just for me."

I could visualize her through the phone-perched on her white leather sofa, the one she jokingly claimed was 'Italian but secretly from IKEA,' hair in its usual glossy helmet, pleading like her entire life hinged on this conversation.

And for a second, I wobbled.


Just a little.


Then I looked up.

The apartment was full of half-packed boxes. My jewelry tools were stuffed into a cardboard wine case,and my coat was still hanging off the door like it hadn't decided whether to stay or bolt.

I remembered exactly why I was moving.

I remembered my mother threatening Yvaine's family business just to shove me into a forced engagement,while treating Catherine like the second coming of Beyoncé.

And suddenly, I wasn't wobbly anymore.

If I caved now, I'd lose every shred of self-respect had left.

"I mean it this time, Louisa," I said slowly, each word deliberate. "This isn't a tantrum. It's not a bluff. I'm not marrying Rhys. I'm sorry."

There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end.

"But-but you and Rhys were fine just a few weeks ago.What happened? Are you seriously calling off the wedding?" Her voice was shaking.

"I've made up my mind. I'm not doing this out of spite,Louisa. It's not a phase. I'm done."

"Mirabelle!" she cried, as if saying my full name would magically change my mind. "I can't accept-"

BANG.

A deafening crash burst through the phone speaker.I heard metal screaming against metal, the sound of everything going sideways in a split second.

"Louisa?! What the hell-Louisa?!"

I gripped my phone so hard my hand went numb.

There was more chaos-shouting, screeching, static-then the call cut out.

My stomach did a nosedive into my boots.
"Louisa?" | called again, voice shaking.

Nothing.

The line was dead.

I redialed Louisa-no answer.Tried Rhys-nothing.Even called Clive Granger, Louisa's husband-voicemail.

The silence on the other end wasn't just eerie. It was wrong.Really bloody wrong.

Heart thudding like a drumnline on Red Bull, I grabbed my bag and phone and bolted. I smashed my phone against the doorframe on the way out-cue a loud "shit!"-then managed to drop my purse on top of it.

"Damn it!"


I crouched down to scoop everything up, hands shaking like I'd just downed five espressos.

The call had ended way too suddenly, too violently.That crash-it didn't sound like bad signal or a phone dropped on the floor.

Was Louisa hurt? Was anyone with her? Had someone called emergency services?

My brain spun itself into a meltdown spiral while I tried -and failed-to shove my lip gloss, keys, and everything else back into my bag.

I was so caught up in my internal catastrophe I didn't notice the lift ding or the footsteps approaching.

Not until someone knelt in front of me and placed steady hands on my trembling shoulders.

"What's wrong?"
###Chapter 14Emergency Room
My head jerked up.

I recognized Ashton. My ridiculously attractive neighbor.



"I think... someone I know might've been in an accident." I swallowed my rising panic. "I need to get to the Granggers'."

The second I had enough brain cells online to function,I fumbled for my phone and ordered an Uber.

I stood up, wobbly, and made it two steps before Ashton caught my arm. "Let me drive you."

"I'm fine,I can-"

"It'll take ages to get a ride from here," he said,already pulling me toward the lift as if I'd agreed."My car's downstairs. It's faster."

He wasn't wrong. Also, I wasn't in the mood to argue Not when my nerves were having a full-blown seizure.

As the lift descended, Ashton made a quick call-something low and calm in that velvet voice of his.

When we reached the lobby, a sleek black car was already waiting at the curb. A guy who looked like his assistant handed over the keys, then melted into the night.
"Passenger side," Ashton said, nodding at the car.

The night air slapped some sense back into me.I climbed in without a word.

Ashton slid into the driver's seat, took the wheel, and floored it.

Only once we were barreling through traffic did it occur to me that I had zero clue where we were even going.

I dug out my phone. "I need to call someone, figure out which hospital-"

Ashton tapped his Bluetooth earpiece and answered a call with a smooth,"Yeah."

Before I could get through to Louisa, Rhys,or even Clive bloody Granger, he ended the call and said,"Louisa Granger's at Eldergrove Private."

I stared. "How the hell-?"

He kept his eyes on the road. "I had my assistant check emergency admissions in the area. You said car accident, mentioned the Granger name. It wasn't exactly a needle in a haystack."

I was too impressed to respond.

Ashton went on, "Louisa Granger was admitted ten minutes ago. She was conscious when they brought her in, but she's being treated now. Multiple injuries."

I gripped my hands together in my lap. My whole body tensed, spine peeling away from the seat like I couldn't sit still even if you superglued me down.
 She'd been rushed in for emergency care. That meant serious. That meant... it could be bad. Life-or-death bad.

Ashton glanced at me, then tapped something on the touchscreen embedded in the dashboard. Soft,calming music began to play-something instrumental and mellow.


"She'll be okay," he said.

The music helped. So did the subtle scent wafting through the car, something clean and woody that l was ninety-nine percent sure was coming from Ashton himself.

We drove in silence for a bit. Then he asked, "She means a lot to you?"

I nodded. "She's probably the best parental figure I've got," I said, then let out a dry little laugh. "Honestly she's been more of a mum to me than my actual mum."

Saying it out loud felt strangely comforting. Like1could finally exhale without choking on the panic.Something in me started to unclench, just a little.

I couldn't help thinking about when I was little and Mum used to make me wear Catherine's hand-me-downs. Picture seven-year-old me drowning in a sparkly unicorn jumper two sizes too big, looking like I'd been mugged by a clearance rack.

Aunt Louisa hated that. She'd whisk me off to hers for dinner, clock my tragic outfit, and the next thing l knew, we were in a department store and she was  holding up dresses like we were auditioning for The Great Kiddie Style Intervention. Then she'd march straight over to my mum's and start a row that could probably be heard in the next district.

After I got engaged to Rhys, every time I got sick-which, to be fair, was no more than once a year-Aunt Louisa was the one sitting beside my hospital bed,feeding me soup and telling the nurses off like she owned the place.

Even without her saying it out loud, I was starting to realize she didn't just see me as a future daughter-in -law. She'd already decided I was hers.

I lowered my head and wiped my eyes.

Had I been selfish breaking things off? Maybe I should've just played along-married Rhys, become Mrs. Rich-and-Repressed, and lived the rest of my life with perfectly curled hair and zero opinions.

Ashton's driving was fast and smooth. We pulled up outside the hospital in record time. The second the tires touched the curb, I shoved the door open and jumped out.

The cold slapped me right in the face. I hunched my shoulders but didn't slow down. At the emergency desk, I asked for Louisa Granger. The nurse gave me the once-over-messy hair, red eyes, possibly a relative-and said, "Eighth floor. Trauma unit."

When I got there, I saw Rhys pacing like he was about to challenge the vending machine to a fistfight.
"How's Louisa?" | asked, bracing myself for the worst.

"Still in surgery. She only went in a few minutes ago,"he muttered, running a hand through his perfectly gelled hair like that would magically calm him down."The doctor said she's got a fractured arm, a busted knee, and some internal bleeding they need to sort.Nothing life-threatening, but they've got to operate."

My shoulders dropped half a centimeter, just enough to feel that it wasn't catastrophic.

But then the guilt swanned in.

Louisa had been on the phone with me when the car hit her. I wasn't the one behind the wheel, obviously,but | couldn't exactly claim full innocence either.

Rhys clearly shared the same thought, because he turned and glared at me balefully.

"She was upset when she found out you weren't coming to dinner," he snapped. "She insisted on calling you. Went outside to do it. If she hadn't-"

"If she hadn't called me, she wouldn't have been hit, is that where we're going?" | crossed my arms, already feeling the heat rise behind my ears.,guess what? If you'd had the balls to tell her l'wasn't showing up and cancel the dinner, she wouldn't have needed to call me in the first place."

His jaw clenched. His fists did too.

For a second, I thought we were about to put the 'emergency' in 'emergency room'.
Experience-fresh and unwanted-had taught me that Rhys wasn't always a pacifist when things didn't go his way.

I stepped back, on guard.
###Chapter 15 Hare -brained ldea
But instead of throwing a punch, Rhys took a deep breath and said, "We need to talk."

I relaxed a little and plopped myself down on a bench in the waiting area. I wasn't going anywhere until Aunt Louisa came out of surgery. If Rhys wanted to talk, he could go ahead. I was fully prepared to ignore every syllable.

He sat next to mé and lowered his voice."I need you to... do something for me."

I kept my eyes glued to the neon-red sign above the operating room door that screamed Surgery In Progress.

Rhys continued. "Look, I'm sorry I lost my temper that day and... hurt you. I apologize."

I turned my head slowly, like I was checking if I'd just hallucinated him saying that.

Rhys Granger, apologizing?

Was he ill?

Had the aliens finally replaced him with a half-decent human clone?


"I'm sorry about how things turned out," he said. "I wish we could work something out. Mum was really upset when she found out we'd had a fight-"

"We didn't just have a fight, Rhys. We broke up." | cut in before he could romanticize it into a bloody rorr com misunderstanding.

He let out a heavy exhale. "Yeah, I know. But Mum doesn't."

I blinked. "You didn't tell her?"

"I said we'd had a fight. That we were, like, on a break.She told me to fix it. She thinks I'm the one who messed up and I'm supposed to win you back with flowers or whatever."

I didn't respond. Mostly because I was too busy mentally filing this under You Cannot Make This Shit Up.

Rhys leaned closer. "Look, I know it's a massive favor,but... would you still be my fiancée? Just for now. Just till Mum's feeling better. I need time to, you know,ease her into the idea of me and Catherine."


Ah, there it was. The cherry on top of the bullshittery sundae.


Rhys wanted me to play pretend fiancée while he cozied up with Catherine behind the scenes.

"You've got to be kidding me," I said, once my brain caught up with the sheer absurdity of it all

"| can pay you," he added, as if he was doing me a favor. "Get you a job at my company, or literally anywhere else in the city. A flat, money, jewelry-whatever you want."

"You seriously think I'm going to play house with you just so you can keep lying to your mum?" I stared at him like he'd grown a second head. A dumber one.

Less than twenty-four hours ago, I'd literally come up with the exact same plan to get my parents off my back.

But somehow, when he suggested it, it made my skin crawl.

Maybe that made me a hypocrite.

Or maybe it just meant I still had some shred of self-respect left, which was more than I could say for him.

"| know it's a lot to ask," he pressed on, because of course he did. Rhys never took no for an answer, at least not from me. His voice sped up like he was trying to close a deal before his mum came out of surgery.

Which only made it worse. His mum had just been in a car crash and he was already here, scheming how to manipulate her feelings.

The man had balls, I'd give him that.

"But this works out well for you too, doesn't it?" he pushed on, absolutely committed to his little pitch "Your parents are pressuring you to date that guy-what's his name? The one you clearly can't stand. But if we're still engaged, they'll back off. You get your peace, I get mine. Win-win."

He actually had the gall to smile. "I won't interfere in your life," he added. "You can date whoever you want, just keep it quiet. My parents can't find out. And I swear it won't take long. A couple of months, tops, then I'll-"

"Then you'll what?" I snapped, barely keeping my voice low enough not to get escorted out by hospital security. "You'll finally grow a backbone and tell your parents that your great romance with Catherine has been bubbling away this whole time and you've been feeding them lies like a goddamn vending machine?"

My voice was shaking. Not from nerves-more like pure rage.




I shot up from the bench. "This is not the place for this. Come with me."




"Wait,where are you going?" Rhys stood too, annoyed.But he followed me anyway as I stormed into the stairwell.


I checked for witnesses, cameras, and possibly the ghost of a nosy janitor. Once the coast was clear,I shut the door behind us.

Rhys shoved his hands into his trouser pockets,impatient. "We need to settle this fast. My dad's on his way, I need to-"

I turned on him so fast he flinched. The light in the stairwell was grim and flickery, like it belonged in a crime documentary re-enactment, but it didn't do much to ruin Rhys's model-groomed hair or perfectly symmetrical face. His custom suit clung to his body  like it had been stitched on by a thirsty tailor.

He looked like the total package. Handsome. Rich.Confident.

Shame the warranty had expired on his decency.

I raised my hand, then paused. A slap would have felt amazing but would have left a mark, and Clive Granger was due to show up any second. No way was I letting this turn into an episode of Law &Order: Pretentious Pricks Unit. 2

So I switched tactics.

I leaned in slowly, looping my arms around Rhys's neck like I was about to kiss him. 1

He blinked, confused, but still smug enough to think he was winning.

"What are you-?"

That's all he managed before I drove my knee straight into his gut.

His breath left him like air from a punctured bouncy castle. Eyes wide, mouth gaping, Rhys folded like a bad poker hand.

I let go and stepped back.

"Since you seem to struggle with the word 'no,' that was my answer to your hare-brained little proposal,"I said, while he continued to wheeze. "I'm not going to help you lie to Louisa. You want to confess your undying love for Catherine? Great. Find another way to do it. But leave me the hell out of it."
 Still doubled over, he made a pathetic grab for my arm,but I was already out of reach.

"You... bitch! You'll regret this!"

###Chapter 16Ashton's POV: Cut the...
Ashton was scanning the hallway when the stairwell door flew open and Mirabelle barrelled out.

She looked furious. Gorgeous, obviously-but furious.

And then, like a nasty aftertaste, Rhys Granger followed her out.

Ashton's jaw tightened. He'd never met the guy in person, but he recognized himn from photos and the extensive background check.

Rhys, the ex-fiancé. A trust fund guy with anger management issues, and apparently, the emotional maturity of a wet sock.

The moment Ashton saw the expression on Rhys's face,he knew what was about to happen. The guy had that look-the same look idiots get right before they do something incredibly stupid.

Ashton moved fast. Long strides, no hesitation.

Mirabelle saw him coming, surprise flickering in her eyes, but there wasn't time to say anything.

Rhys was already raising his arm, going for a cheap shot from behind like the absolute coward he was.

Ashton didn't,think. He just moved.

His left arm wrapped around Mirabelle's waist,yanking her out of range, while his right leg shot out and slammed into Rhys's knee with the kind of precision that made footballers cry.

Rhys folded like a broken deckchair and crashed into the stairwell wall with a satisfying thud.

When she understood what just happened,Mirabelle didn't flinch. She simply stared at Rhys with disdain.

"Really? That's your move?" She shook her head."Trying to punch me when my back's turned? Christ,Rhys, I knew you were a spineless little worm, but this is pathetic, even for you."

Ashton looked down at her, checking her face. "You all right?"

She nodded. "I'm fine. Thanks."

"Let's get out of here."

Mirabelle hesitated. "Louisa's still in surgery."

Ashton gave Rhys a pointed glance. "Yeah, but you don't need to spend the next few hours in a corridor with him. My assistant's on standby. He'll call the second there's any update. The surgery could take all night. You being here doesn't make the clock tick faster."

She thought it over, then nodded. "Fair enough."

Ashton walked her to the car, opened the door, and waited until she was tucked inside before sliding into the driver's seat and starting the engine.

But even as they pulled away, his eyes kept darting to the rear-view mirror like she might vanish if he blinked

She looked pensive. What was she thinking about?Louisa? Rhys? Him?

Ashton didn't believe in fate-he trusted planning,power, and contracts-but he still thanked whatever cosmic nonsense had convinced him to return to Skyline City earlier than planned.

If he hadn't, he wouldn't have seen her break up with Rhys, wouldn't have been the man she dragged away from a bar for a one-night stand, and definitely wouldn't have ended up playing the role of her fake fiancé.

She didn't know it yet, but Ashton had no intention of staying fake for long.

That morning in the hotel, when he asked if she remembered him, her blank stare hadn't surprised him.

Disappointed him,yes.

But surprised? Not really.

Seven years was a long time, and she'd only been a teenager back then-baby-faced, all nerves and big dreams, standing on a stage at some inter-school tech expo, pitching her clunky smart jewellery prototype like she was about to revolutionize the entire industry.

She'd looked terrified, but there was a kind of fire in her,the sort that made people stop and pay attention,even in a room full of bored judges and cynical  investors.

Ashton hadn't been one of them, not officially. Just doing a favor for a friend, reviewing submissions for a grant.

But then she tripped on her way out, and he caught her before she hit the ground.

She'd looked up, breathless and wide-eyed, thanked him like he'd saved her life, and disappeared before he could say a single word.

She never knew his name. Probably didn't even register his face.

But he remembered everything.

Now here she was again, older, tougher,still standing tall after being dragged through hell by a man who didn't deserve her and a family that never protected her.


Ashton wasn't letting her walk away. Not this time.

The fake engagement was just the opening move.

When he'd told her his family was pressuring him to get married,he hadn't lied.

The vultures had been circling since he landed back in Skyline-cousins with matchmakers, uncles with ultimatums, his stepmother with her trademark emotional blackmail.

What he left out was the part where he could've shut it all down with one Look. His family didn't push him;they tiptoed around him. They feared him, and that suited him just fine.

But he let her believe the pressure was real. Gave her the whole "expectations" speech because he knew it would make her soften, make her say yes.

But he knew this wasn't about convenience or family pressure.




It was about her.

The only woman who'd ever made his heart stutter.

The only one he'd ever wanted for more than a night.

The only one he wanted for every night, for the rest of his life.




Now she was in his passenger seat,legs crossed,face turned to the window, breathing like she hadn't completely undone him just days ago in that hotel room.

He should've been watching the road, but his eyes kept sliding to her-her profile in the low light,the way her fingers twitched against her thigh, the soft scent of her shampoo threading through the air.

She smelled like sugar and fire. Like trouble he'd gladly ruin himself for.

She'd been tipsy that night. He hadn't. He remembered it all.




He remembered the exact sound she made when he kissed the inside of her thigh. The way her hands gripped his hair. The way she arched her back as she came.
 When they shook hands on the fake engagement deal, she didn't know he already had the ending written.

A real ring. A real marriage. Her signature next to his on everything from a marriage license to a cemetery plot.

And maybe she still thought this was a favor. A temporary fix.

But Ashton knew better.

She was already his.

And if she didn't know it yet, he'd make damn sure she did-soon.

He stole another glance at her.

He could feel the heat rise just thinking about that night. The sound of her voice, her skin against his.

But another thought made his jaw clench: if he hadn't shown up at that bar, would she have gone home with someone else? Someone with a pretty face like that smug bastard Rhys?

Ashton's grip on the steering wheel tightened. He would burn down the city before he let anyone like that near her again.

It was time to move faster. Cut the pretence. Turn this engagement into something permanent.

And if he had to lie, manipulate, or play every dirty card he had to keep her?
So be it.
###Chapter 17 One Step Further
"You alright?"

His voice snapped me out of my mental spiral.

"What?" I blinked at him, my brain still buffering.

Ashton gave me a quick side glance. "Earlier. At the hospital. Did he... hurt you?"

"You mean Rhys?" | said."No."

Technically true.

Not for lack of trying, though.

Rhys practically lived at the gym,probably had protein shakes for blood. If he'd landed a hit, I'd have been scraping bits of myself off the floor with a dustpan.

I added, softer this time, "Thank you."

He didn't say "you're welcome."

Instead, his grip on the steering wheel went full Incredible Hulk-veins popping as if they were auditioning for a fitness ad.

I stared.


Was he angry? At me? At Rhys?

"That was your ex-fiancé?" he finally asked, voice low."Yeah."
 He looked like he had about seven things he wanted to say, and none of them were polite enough for public consumption. In the end, he just nodded and stared straight ahead.

The rest of the drive was silent. Not awkward-silent,just...broody.

We got to the apartment and rode the lift up in silence. At my door, I turned to him and said, "Thanks.Good night."

He didn't reply. He just stood there, his face unreadable in the dim hallway light.

I dug out my keys and was halfway through the door when-


"Wait."


I turned, giving him the eyebrow.

He held up his phone. "Here's my number," he said,airdropping it to me. "Once Louisa Granger's out of surgery, I'll let you know."

"Thanks," I said, and meant it. He didn't owe me-or Louisa-anything. But he'd gone out of his way anyway.

His gaze drifted over my shoulder into the living room,and his brows went up.

"You seriously planning to spend the night in that?"

I glanced behind me. Boxes were stacked like a game of adult Jenga, most of my stuff taped up and ready to go, the bed stripped bare, the wardrobe gutted.

Right,I kind of forgot I was moving out tomorrow and had packed all my stuff.

"It's just one night. I'll make do," I said with the confidence of someone who fully intended to sleep on a rolled-up hoodie.

"Why don't you come over to mine?"

I turned back to him slowly, trying to work out if I'd just hallucinated that sentence.

His tone was neutral. His face completely expressionless, like he'd just offered to lend me a socket wrench instead of, you know, his bed.

Was this an innocent offer? Or was he hinting at a sequel to Hotel Night: The Pantsless Saga?

My brain was so fried it couldn't spell "context," let alone process it.




"Um... thanks, but I don't think-"


"That guy Rhys knows where you live, doesn't he?"Ashton steamrolled over my polite rejection. "If he's blaming you for his mum's crash, how long do you think it'll take before he turns up here to settle the score?"


I opened my mouth, but all that came out was a very unhelpful, "Um..."




The man had a point. Rhys had an ego the size of a small country, and nothing bruised it worse than losing,especially to a woman.

And not just any woman. Me. The one who used to trail after him like a lovesick Labrador.
"And your family's still tight with the Grangers, right?If they hear about Louisa's accident, there's a good chance they'll either call or show up in person. Do you really want that circus on your doorstep tonight?"

I let out a sigh. "Fair point. Thanks. If it's not a huge inconvenience, I might crash in your living room for the night. I'll take the couch, promise."

I knew his place had the same layout as mine, and there was no guest room.

He might've smiled, though it was hard to telL in the light. "Good. We've got a few things we need to talk about anyway."

I followed him into his flat.

"Drink?" he asked, heading over to the sleek little minibar wedged between the living room and the kitchen.


"Sure." I took the glass he handed me-some fancy Japanese whisky with an unpronounceable name-and took a sip. It went down smooth, like silk soaked in fire,and I felt the tension in my shoulders start to give up and move out.

I stifled a yawn. It wasn't even ten yet, but the day had been a long one.

"About the party the day after tomorrow," he said, his voice casual, but I could tell from the way he leaned on the bar that this wasn't just small talk.

"Yeah?" I blinked away the sleep threatening to hijack  my brain and looked at him.

He was watching me again with that same unreadable expression-not creepy, not flirty,just...observant.Like a cat that couldn't decide if you were a threat or a chew toy.

"Considering what went down today, I think it's time to revise the terms of our arrangement."

Arrangement. Right. The fake engagement.

I waited for the rest.

"I'm guessing from his charming performance tonight that Rhys Granger isn't quite ready to let you go."

"Yeah,you could say that." I gave a wry little laugh.

Normally, I wasn't one to unpack personal baggage with strangers.

But Ashton didn't feellike a person you had to tiptoe around.

Maybe it was because we made a deal. Maybe it was the way he talked about everything in a matter-of-fact way, like he was discussing stock prices instead of my messy love life.

So I told him about Rhys's absurd request to keep pretending we were still engaged just so he could ease his new relationship with Catherine into his parents 'approval.

"You turned him down," Ashton said-not as a question,but as a statement.

"Yeah. Took me years to wrap my head around the fact that he's completely besotted with Catherine.I spent far too long playing the role of emotionally available placeholder. I'm not signing up for that encore performance."


"Rhys Granger doesn't strike me as someone who takes no for an answer."


I gave a shrug. That one he nailed.

"And then there's your family," he added. "From what I've gathered, your mum won't give up untilshe's set you up with someone she approves of, regardless of how you feel."

"Exactly. Which is why I needed you to come to a family dinner next week. As my fiancé."

"But do you think that'll be enough?"

I tilted my head. "What are you getting at?"

"Engagements can be broken off," he said,setting his glass down. Then he walked over and stopped right in front of me.

Since I was still sitting on the sofa, he basically eclipsed the ceiling light like a very expensive solar event.I had to crane my neck to look up at him.

"Pretending to be engaged isn't going to magically make your parents or Rhys disappear."

"So what, you want me to fake a pregnancy too?" |asked, only half joking.

"No," he said, dead serious. "I'm suggesting we take it a step further."

"You mean actually get engaged?"

"No. I mean get married."

###Chapter 18 Almost Said Yes
i stood in the shower like a soggy pretzel, hoping the scalding water would burn the confusion out of my skull.

Spoiler alert: it didn't.

Ashton's words kept looping: "Let's get married for real."

Excuse me? Was I concussed? Had I slipped and hit my head and developed some sexy-rich-boy-themed delusions?

Because, last I checked, we were in a mutually agreed fake engagement. No strings, no vows, no wedding hashtags.

And yet, there he was, five minutes ago, standing in front of me with that infuriatingly composed face and that annoyingly persuasive baritone, dropping a "let's get hitched" like he was suggesting brunch.

I mean, what even was that?

He had leaned in, speaking in that velvet-coated,emotionless CEO tone like he was negotiating a merger, but the only thing merging in my brain was every single R-rated thought I had ever had about him.

I hadn't registered a single word, too busy inhaling his scent, staring at his lips, and letting my dumb,horny body teeter on the edge of blurting out yes.

Thank God for the ringing phone that cut through the haze before | threw myself at him.

I cranked the water hotter, gently bumped my forehead against the tile, and groaned.

What was wrong with me? The second Ashton appeared, my logic disappeared like a side character in a horror film, leaving my poor brain cells to fend for themselves against thetsunami of testosterone and abs.


I wondered if he saw through my act, if he knew that while he talked about strategic alliances, all I could think about was how his Adam's apple might taste.

If he ever realized I was so into him that I wasn't even listening to his perfectly sensible, legally airtight proposal and was just picturing him naked... I'd actually die. Of humiliation. Possibly on the spot.

"Damn it," I muttered, smacking the tap as if it owed me money.




I tried to rationalize it: maybe it was just the post-Rhys drought. After all, it had been awhile. My libido had gone into hibernation and Ashton had apparently jump-started it back to life.

Besides, it wasn't all my fault. Even Agent Peggy Carter nearly face-planted into Steve Rogers' pecs after the serum transformation, and she was literally a government-trained professional.
 If she couldn't resist a good set of chesticles, what hope did I have?


I was just a regular woman with a pulse. And a highly reactive, dangerously thirsty hormone system.

By the time | stepped out of my extra-long shower,my fingers were prunier than a sad raisin in the sun.

I stood in front of my wardrobe. Do I wear my usual sleepwear, which consisted of a threadbare uni tee with a coffee stain shaped suspiciously like Australia and a pair of shorts so tiny they'd get flagged on Instagram?

Or do I pretend to have dignity and put on something that didn't scream "I'm trying to seduce you"?

In the end, I reached for a long, ankle-length dressing gown I'd bought during a misguided boho phase and never worn again. It was shapeless, scratchy, and about as flattering as a camping tarp.

I tiptoed out of my flat and paused at Ashton's door.


He hadn't pressured me for an answer when he suggested we get married. Said I should take my time and think about it.


But honestly, I was terrified that if I saw those hypnotic eyes of his again, I'd throw all rational thought out the window and say

Worse, I was worried I'd be desperate enough to suggest we celebrate our new relationship status with a cheeky roll in the sheets.
 Not that that was something I'd usually do.

Then again, I wasn't really a one-night-stand kind of girl either. Or a fake fiancée kind of girl.

Apparently, I was going through a phase called "acting completely out of character and confusing the hell out of myself."

When I finally pushed open the door to his place and saw the empty living room, I wasn't sure if | was relieved or gutted.

Possibly both.

He had left a note on the coffee table. Said he had to fly to another city for urgent business but he'd be back in time for the party. Also said I could treat the place like mine.

Dangerous words. Because five seconds later, I was standing in his bedroom weighing the moral implications of crashing on his sofa versus full-on starfishing in his bed.

The bed won.

It smelled like him, and I slept like a baby.

Next morning, I woke up to find that my mum had called me roughly two dozen times and left a string of messages long enough to qualify as a podcast.Each one more shouty than the last, blaming me for Louisa's accident.

Rhys might have called too, but | wouldn't know-l'd blacklisted him as soon as I'd left the hospital There was also a message from Ashton. Louisa was out of surgery but still in ICU, loopy on anesthetic and not up for visitors.

I texted back a quick thank you and inhaled a breakfast of cold toast and half a banana.


Then it was time for work.

I'd barely set foot in the studio when I got summoned to the boss's office.

Nyx Collective was a high-end jewelry design house co-founded by two bosses, but one of them was basically a ghost. As in, no one had seen him. Not once. He could've been an Al for all I knew.

Word on the street was that this mystery founder had bankrolled 80% of the start-up costs,which made him the real power behind the velvet curtain.


Anyway, the person currently sitting across from me wasn't that elusive financier, but the other boss. The one who did the actual work.


Savannah Lane was pushing forty but looked like she'd just been cast as the sexy barista in a romcom.Glowing skin, hair like a shampoo ad, and a wardrobe that screamed "rich but relatable."

"Vanna, I'm really sorry," I said as soon as I walked in,before she could unleash the guilt-tripping Kraken. "I know this week was a nightmare for the studio and l just... disappeared. I was sick, then there was other stuff, and time sort of did that thing where it flings itself into a volcano."
 "Relax." Savannah smiled at me. "I didn't drag you in here to scold you. I'm giving you a bonus."
###Chapter 19Office Nemesis
"A what now?" My brain did a double take and tripped over its own feet.




Savannah's grin widened. "That necklace you designed?The one Eliza Black wore on the red carpet last week?It blew up. Press coverage, socials, even one of those trashy gossip TikToks. Nyx Collective finally went viral,andit's thanks to you."

Huh. I relaxed. So'l wasn't getting fired today.


"So here's the deal," she added breezily. "Ten grand.It'll be in your account by the end of the day."

I nearly hugged her. Nearly. But I settled for a deeply heartfelt thank you and a facial expression that screamed "I suddenly believe in capitalism again."

Back at my desk-yes, freelancers got cubicles too at Nyx Collective, mostly for the aesthetic-l dropped into my chair and tried to act casual. Which was difficult, because my inner monologue was doing the cha-cha to the sound of incoming funds.

Clearly, word had already spread, because no sooner had I logged in than someone from the next desk leaned over and whispered, "I'm so jealous. Ten thousand in one go? I'd sell a kidney for that kind of payday."
"I mean, the studio's basically mainstream now,"another designer piped up. "We've all got a shot at a viral moment."


| gave them a modest little smile-the kind you practice in the mirror when you're trying not to look smug but still want people to know you're successful.

We were having a perfectly nice moment-bit of a gossip sesh, bit of humblebragging about my bonus-when a voice behind me sliced through the air like a rusty nail file.

"She just got lucky, that's all. Eliza Black could've picked anything. Total fluke."

I looked up and to the left, already bracing myself.And there she was. Violet Lin. Designer, full-time drama queen, and my not-so-secret workplace nemesis. If I was the shiny new MacBook Air, she was the Dell laptop that kept overheating but swore she was "just as good, actually."

Violet had been trying to outdo me since the day l walked into Nyx Collective with a sketchbook. She'd decided I was the obstacle between her and the sparkly throne of Top Designer, and she'd been waging a war ever since.

The second she opened her mouth, the whole room fell quieter than a group chat after someone types "I need to vent." Everyone knew Violet and I didn't mix.

She strutted past me, all clacking stilettos and cloying perfume.
"Honestly, did any of you see the trending threads?People online are saying Nyx Collective stuff looks cheap now. One necklace, and the brand goes from boutique elegance to bargain bin Barbie."

She tossed her hair like a shampoo model.

Right on cue, one of her usual background extras piped up with a helpful echo: "Totally. They're roasting Eliza,but really they're dragging the necklace."

Ah, the classic tag-team shade. Subtle as a sledgehammer.




I tossed my pen down and turned, meeting her eyes dead on.




"Most of the reviews are singing her praises, darling.People are calling Eliza's necklace a masterpiece. So where exactly is this imaginary/ 'roast' you're talking about? Or wait, don't tell me. You're either snacking on troll crumbs for breakfast or you genuinely think cubic zirconia is the pinnacle of design. Which is it? Be honest, we won't judge-out loud."

The silence was instant. Delicious.

I glanced in the direction of Savannah's office. "Maybe I should ask Vanna if we've got overstaffing issues.Sounds like someone's got way too much free time and WiFi."


Everyone suddenly discovered their laptops were fascinating and started typing like their lives depended on it. After all, I'd just landed a fat bonus and was firmly in Savannah's good books. No one with half a  brain wanted beef with the boss's current golden girl.

But Violet Lin wasn't wired like the rest of us.

"Some people really think they're something just because they got ten grand. I mean, only people who are seriously broke would act like it's a big deal."

I let out a laugh. "Sure, some people might turn their noses up at ten grand... but then again, their designs aren't even worth ten bucks. It's kind of tragic when you think about it, spending your whole life sketching crap no celebrity would be caught dead in. And if my necklace 'lowered the brand's image', then someone's didn't even make it onto the radar."


Someone behind'me snorted hard enough to nearly choke on her iced matcha.


Violet turned the same shade as her lipstick and slammed her coffee cup down. "Excuse me? Are you saying my designs have no class? Just because your little necklace ended up on Eliza Black's neck? Please.Like I even rate her."

I shrugged. "I didn't mention any names. Funny how you brought yourself up,though. Bit of a self-drag,no?"

That shut her up real fast.

The office blessedly dipped into sweet, glorious silence. For a total of... what? Ninety seconds, maybe.

Then she was at it again, flapping her gums with the girl next to her like we were on a break in Year 9homeroom.
 "Did you hear?" she said, loud enough to rattle the windows. "The Laurent family's throwing a gala. Word is, the heir himself is making a public appearance.Only the most influential people in Skyline are invited.And guess who just got an invitation?"

The moment she dropped the L-word, everyone perked up like meerkats at feeding time. I swear, one of the interns nearly dislocated a neck trying to lean closer.


Because yeah, the Laurent family basically ran the city.Skyline's economic puppeteers. And their heir had never been seen in public. Zero photos. Just rumors and a PR team tighter than a nun's wardrobe.

Apparently, getting an invite to this gala was harder than getting Taylor Swift tickets during presale.People were shelling out stupid money or calling in favors like it was their final wish on a deathbed.


Violet tilted her chin up, beaming as people gathered around her like she was royalty.

"Some people," she drawled, flicking a look in my direction, "could design the Mona Lisa out of rhinestones and still die broke. They'll never get a Laurent invite. It's tragic, really."

She even threw in a couple of pity clucks, like a gossiping aunt at a family reunion. Subtlety was not her strong suit.

I didn't even blink. Kept right on sketching.

Then my phone dinged.
Yvaine had sent a photo of a dress and a message:

[Picked out the shiniest, sexiest dress ever. You're gonna slay that party. Make Rhys Granger eat his heart out. MWAH!!!]
###Chapter 20 Clean Slate


After work, I crashed Yvaine's shoot. She was wrapping up a final round of photos for some artsy indie boutique no one's heard of but everyone pretends to love.

When she finally changed out of a chainmail minidress and stilettos, we hit one of her regular haunts-this little boutique in West 7th called Spitfire. She'd sweet-talked the owner into holding a dress she claimed had my name stitched into its soul.

One look at the dress, and I stopped breathing. Crimson satin. Plunging neckline. A thigh-high slit that could probably cause traffic accidents.

I gawked. "You're kidding. I can't wear that."

"Why not?"

"Just... not my usual style."

"That's the point, honey. You've got one shot to stun a crowd and make a man spiral," Yvaine said, hands on her hips. "This is it. You're not showing up as yourself tomorrow. You're showing up as the woman every other woman wants to be, and every man regrets losing."

"Bit dramatic," I muttered.

"Bit iconic," she snapped. "Now shut up and try it on."

Even the sales girl chimed in, "If I had your waist and that ex, I'd show up dressed like vengeance too."

I bought the damn dress.

Back at my new flat-tiny, sunlit, and finally mine-l hung up the dress in the closet and flopped onto the sofa.The moving crew had dropped everything off earlier. Rhys didn't know this address. My parents didn't either.Clean slate.

On the way home, I'd dropped by the hospital. Louisa was out of surgery, recovering, still closed off to visitors. I didn't push. I didn't want her guilt-tripping me into forgiving her son and left before Rhys showed up.
Now I stood in front of my miror, holding up earrings against my neck. I had no clue if Ashton's family preferred pearls or diamonds, saints or sinners. Tomorrow's party wasn't just about dress codes and canapétrays. it was his grand announcement: Meet my fake fiancée. All I had to do was nod and smile and play nice.

I should've asked him what they were like. Cold? Conservative? Open to women who've made at least two of their leering male colleagues cry in public?

Ashton hadn't told me. He was off somewhere "on business," which, let's be honest, could mean anything from mergers to murder. I didn't even know the name of his company.

The stove clicked off behind me, and I was just about to sit down when the doorbell rang.

Every cell in my body jolted. No one knew I'd moved except Yvaine. I crept to the peephole.

A second later, I opened the door.

Ashton stood there.Hoodie. Joggers. Sharp-eyed and aggravatingly handsome.

"Just got back from the trip. Thought I'd drop by."

My brain glitched. For a second, I thought I'd hallucinated myself back into my old apartment, the one where he lived across the hall and could pop by at any moment. But nope. I turned and stared at the stack of unopened moving boxes behind me. This was my new place. My clean slate.

"How the hell did you find me?"

He didn't blink. "Made a few calls."

Of course he did. Same man who'd tracked Louisa's hospital room faster than I could Google 'where's the nearest ER centre'. I hated how fast he moved, how smug he looked while doing it. I hated that I was also...impressed.

I should've felt violated, probably. Most people take weeks to get a couch delivered-he tracked my new address in less time than it takes to boil pasta.

But he didn't radiate creep energy. Just power. Cold, inconvenient,casually terrifying power.

"Did you come straight from the airport? You look-"|trailed off, noticing the lack of a suitcase. His joggers were tailored, his T-shirt suspiciously wrinkle-free. Not travel clothes. Not jet-lagged.
"No.° He gave me that infuriatingly calm stare. "I bought the flat across the hall."

I swallowed hard. So that was the plan. We were neighbors agáln. Perfect.

Then he added, deadpan, "If we're going to be engaged-and maybe, soon, married-I thought proximity would help."

My jaw twitched. So he'd gone from fáke flancé to fake husband in under ten seconds.

I didn't say anything. Couldn't. My brain was buffering, trying to download a reaction from the chaos cloud in my chest. I wasn't ready to commit to another lie when I was still unpacking from the last one.

He didn't push. Just shrugged. "It'll be easier if we're seen coming and going together. My family likes to pry."

Of course they do.

I nodded. Mostly because saying 'what the actual hell' felt rude.

The silence stretched. Not awkward yet, but almost.

"You eaten?" | blurted.

He arched an eyebrow, like he wasn't sure if that was an offer or a trap.

"Come in," I said, already regretting it.

Inside, the place still smelled like fresh paint and furniture polish. I reheated my sad little dinner-leftover pasta, garlic bread that had gone soggy in the fridge, and a salad that barely passed for edible.

He didn't flinch. Just sat at my cramped table like it was the Ritz and accepted the meal like it was a tasting menu. Didn't even comment on the stainless-steel cutlery, which honestly felt like handing royalty a spork.

He ate like he'd gone to finishing school with Bond villains. Knife in his right hand, posture too perfect for someone in loungewear.

I tried to fill the silence. "So... what exactly do you do, Ashton?"

He cut a piece of garlic bread with surgical precision. "Business."

"That's specific."

"It's what it is."

He wasn't chatty. But he wasn't a wall either. Every time I asked him something, Ashton answered-short, to the point, polite. But he never asked anything back. No follow-ups, no elaboration. Just clean, efficient replies like a human email.

I tossed a glance at the TV, trying to fish for common ground.

"You ever watch The Spite Club?" I nodded at the screen, where two reality stars were waterboarding each other with kombucha.

His expression didn't even twitch.

Fair enough. That show was garbage.

But then the financial news came on-stocks, suits, the usual late-capitalist meltdown-and that got a flicker out of him. Not much, just a look. But it landed.

Finance guy, then. Banker or shark. Probably both.

Midway through dinner, my phone buzzed. Unknown number. I ignored it. Probably another telemarketer.

Then a text popped up:

[You should really reconsider pretending to be my fiancée. Just until my mum gets better. Agree to play along, and I'll forgive you for the assault at the hospital.]

I snorted. Only one man could turn manipulation into charity and still sound smug doing it.

I blocked Rhys's new number and deleted the text.

I must have made a face because Ashton looked up and asked, "Rhys Granger?"

I nodded and shrugged. "Still trying to cast me in his personal soap opera."

He didn't say a word. I figured that was the end of it.

Then he stood up, disappeared down the hallway, and came back with two suit bags. Designer labels.
Obnoxiously expensive. Clearly men's clothes.

"What's this?"|asked.

＂Stage dressing，＂ he said. ＂If you＇re not ready to escalate the fake engagement into a fake marriage， we＇月need something else to make it believable. Like living together."

"That's overkfll."

"If I could find your new address, so can he." His voice was flat. "Couple grand to a Pl. Or two phone calls,tops."

He had a point.

"If Rhys shows up, ITl handle him,"I said.

"No doubt. But a few suits in the closet might make him hesitate. Make him believe the lie before he tries to rewrite it."

raised an eyebrow. "Or I could just show up to his place, shove my tongue down your throat, and finally nake him believe I'm with someone else now."

Silence.

winced."Sorry. That was-"

"Not a bad idea," he said, voice unreadable. "If he shows up and you need to sell the act, call me."

barked out a nervous laugh and scooped up the suits. "Let's call that Plan B, shall we? I'll, um... P'll hang these up."

 ###Chapter 21 Party


The Laurent family estate sat alone on top of a private hill, as if it thought it was too good to share real estate with the rest of us. The only way up was a winding mountain road that made my stomach do backflips.

Lately, all anyone in Skyline could talk about was the elusive Laurent heir-as if he were the second coming of Gatsby, but with better hair. I'd heard his name so many times it started to feel like subliminal messaging. At this point, I had to see what all the fuss was about.

Traffic on the way up was a nightmare-Skyline's elite crawling up the mountain like glittery ants in black-tinted SUVs. We weren't even at the top when Yvaine told the driver to pull over.

She got out first. I followed, tugging my dress down an inch-not that it helped.

Technically, I should have arrived with Ashton to sell the whole engagement thing. But he'd texted to say he'd be running late.

Yvaine hooked her arm through mine as we walked up the rest of the way on foot.

The dress she picked for me was... bold. A silver slip covered in enough rhinestone fringe to double as a disco ball. Definitely not my usual style, but tonight wasn't about subtlety. The thing clung to me like a second skin, sparkling even in the patchy mountain moonlight.

And the slit? Let's just say one wrong move and I'd be charged with public indecency. I'd paired it with silver stilettos that made my calves look deadly and my ankles sharp enough to cut glass.

With my hair pinned up and a pearl clip at the back, I almost passed for classy.Almost.

By the time we reached the Laurent gates, I was trying not to stare but-bloody hell. Even the door was smug. A giant wrought-iron monstrosity with gold accents and enough marble to pave a Greek tragedy.

Now, the Carlisles weren't exactly paupers. Yvaine's family practically ran Skyline's social scene, and her brother had been expanding the family empire as if Monopoly were a blood sport. Still, even she raised an eyebrow at the sheer ridiculousness of it all.

"Is that... a fountain inside the gate?" she whistled.
I nodded."With flamingos. Real ones."

We'd barely stepped into the ballroom when the crowd turned.

Heads swiveled. Mouths parted. Champagne flutës paused mid-air.

Yvaine made quite the entrance. She wore a strapless red dress that hugged her like it had stock in her waistline,and I figured I didn't look too shabby, either.

I scanned the room for Ashton. No sign of him. Just a sea of manicured women and Botoxed men pretending they weren't checking each other's net worth. I wondered which ones were Ashton's family.

He'd apparently decided this circus of a party was the perfect setting for me to meet his parents for the first ime-public enough so they wouldn't throw drinks or start interrogating me in full CIA mode. Crowded enough that any "nice to meet you" would be short, polite, and over before I had a chance to trip over someone's surname.

Nhile Yvaine and I were busy scanning the crowd, the crowd was busy scanning us.

Nomen looked like they were either about to compliment us or commit a hate crime. Men stared like they vere seeing cleavage for the first time.

That's Yvaine Carlisle-Carlisle family heiress," someone whispered behind me. "But the one next to her?Nho is that?"

Mirabelle Vance," someone else chimed in, sounding way too smug about it."She's marrying Rhys Granger.Nedding's coming up soon. No wonder she's glowing."

Pfft, glowing my arse. Everyone knows she's just clinging to Rhys. He doesn't even like her. Got someone else on the side, apparently."

'Please. Mirabelle Vance is a nobody. Even her own family doesn't back her. She's just some barista,right?_atching onto Rhys is the only thing she's got going for her."

The ladies were whispering like we didn't have ears. Low voices, but not low enough. Every word floated straight over to us like smoke from a bad barbecue.

Yvaine's eyes snapped up. She took one look at the group and started striding over as if she was about to stage a very well-dressed homicide.
"Yvle," I grabbed her wrist. "Not here. It's the Laurents' party. If you deck someone in this ballroom, we'll be blackHsted from every gala tifl we're sixty."

She huffed. "They're the ones running their mouths. If this bloody dress weren't so tight, Pd be over there turning cheeks into handprints."

Relatable.

But I wasn't mad. Not really. Their gossip was so off-script it wasn't even offensive-it was just outdated. The real social sharks would already know Rhys and I were done.

Although... Rhys probably hadn't told anyone. Definitely not Louisa. And definitely not the family friends who'd rat him out to her.

Because if there was one thing Rhys Granger couldn't stand, it was the idea that I walked away first.

"Are you just going to let them get away with it?" Yvaine seethed.

"Nope."

I used to swallow that crap. Every side-eye, every whisper, every woman who told me l'd never be enough for him. I swallowed it because | thought Rhys was worth it.

Newsflash: he wasn't.

So I picked up a glass of juice from the drinks table-cranberry, pretty and dangerous-looking-and strolled over to the cackling hens.

The one who'd been talking the most stood dead center, buried in a lavender tulle monstrosity. Pearls everywhere. Big ones. Like she'd raided her grandma's jewelry box.

As soon as they saw me, they went silent. Blinked. Smiled as if they hadn't just been slandering me.

I smiled too, and held out the glass to Miss Lavender. "I would've offered you soap, but since I don't carry that in my clutch, you'll have to make do with cranberry juice."

She didn't take it. Just stared at the glass as if it was about to bite her.

I didn't move. Just stood there, hand extended. Waiting.

Silence stretched.
A few people turned to watch.

I didn't move a muscle.

Whatever was on my face must have told her that this wasn't a bluff.

If she didn't take the juice, I'd pour it over her blowout without blinking.
 ###Chapter 22 Accusations


The woman stared at me, then snatched the juice. "Thanks, Miss Vance."

"No worries," I said, smirking as I grabbed Yvaine's arm and pulled her away.

Behind us, the chatter faded.

Yvaine hissed, "Your stare just turned her skin fifty shades darker."

I chuckled. "I know their type. Quick to talk behind your back, but frozen when you look them in the eye-especially in public."

We drifted towards the dessert tables-two twenty-meter feasts of cakes and champagne. With no threat of juice sabotage, I snagged a mini éclair and shoved it in my mouth.

The gossiping ladies lingered nearby, their eyes darting between us and their empty glasses. Wisely, they shifted focus and moved on to the Laurent family's heir.

"A few years ago, the Laurents didn't even acknowledge that grandson of theirs. Didn't give him a single share.Nothing."

"And yet he went overseas and built his own company. Bigger than Laurent Global Holdings, from what heard."

"Yeah, and I heard Edouard Laurent got seriously ill some years back, and LGH started to struggle. No one in the family had the skills to save it, so suddenly the prodigal grandson wasn't so useless anymore."

"They dragged him back thinking he'd work for free. Do them a favor. What they didn't expect was for the young Mr. Laurent to quietly take control of the whole thing."

"My husband says he's now the actual boss of LGH."

"Not that he needs it. His own company makes LGH look like a roadside lemonade stand."

"Maybe that's what the family's worried about, that he doesn't need them. That's why the party."

"What do you mean?"
"Haven't you heard? This party is the Laurents' way of making It clear that he's family now. Making it official,you know. So people will stop calling him a bastard child."

I gave Yvaine a questioning look.

As expected, she knew more than the Gossip Ladles and dished the dirt.

"Young Mr. Laurent wasn't always a Laurent. Rumor has it he was sort of pushed aside as a kid. His morn died when he was a teenager. Dad remarried. The rest of the family treated him like trash, sent him off with a suitcase and a pat on the back. But now they need him to bail out the company. That's why all the ceremony."

I picked up a lemon tart. His story hit close to home. "He must've been ruthless to claw his way to the top."

Yvaine nodded. "He must be. Though I haven't met him yet. That's what everyone's here for."

We made our way to a corner sofa.

Laughter stopped me mid-stride.

A ring of young women surrounded a familiar face-Violet Lin.

She hadn't noticed me yet.

"I swear," Violet was boasting, "that necklace sold out weeks ago. You'd need an advance on your inheritance to get one now."

it really the same necklace Eliza Black wore on the red carpet?" one girl murmured.

"It's so nice! And only thirty grand," another cooed. "I'd kill for one."

Violet lifted her chin, basking in their admiration.

I stared at the necklace she was wearing.

Just yesterday, she'd dismissed this piece. Now she was wearing it like the crown jewels.

"I've been buried at Nyx Collective," Violet pretended to complain. "Thank God my boss gave me leave for this party."

Someone perked up. "You work there? Then you know who designed this?"
Violet's grin faltered, then turned smug again. "Yes, I'm a designer at Nyx."

"So you made this?" the glrl pressed, eyes bright.

Violet hesltated, then nodded.

They crowded in, eager for a better look at the"must-have" accessory.

"That's nonsense! That's Mira's design," Yvaine snapped. "You had nothing to do with it."

Silence swept over the marble hall. Everyone stared. Heads turned.

When she saw me, Violet paled so much her mascara looked ready to run.

Her proud smile faded. She jabbed a polished finger at me. "Mirabelle Vance, this isn't your crowd. How did you get in? Did you sneak in or fake an invite?"

Before I could respond, Yvaine whipped two crisp envelopes from her clutch and slapped them onto Violet's palm.

"Official Laurent invite," se said. "Addressed to Mira and me. Where's yours?"

"My what?" Violet kept staring at me.

"Your invite."

"It's... in my purse."

"Care to show it?"

"Why?"

"Just humor me." Yvaine shrugged. "Unless you don't have one."

"L.." Violet reached into her purse but left her hand there.

Yvaine crossed her arms. "I'm waiting."

"I must have...misplaced it."

"Or you don't have one. You came as someone's plus one, didn't you? Or did you sneak in through the back door?"
The whole hall fell sllent. Violet's cheeks burned.

I winced a little. As much as I wasn't a Violet fan, even I had to admit, watching her get roasted by Yvaine in front of so many people was... brutál.

Stil1, I wasn't about to help her.

I said to Violet, "I know exactly why you tried to accuse us of crashing. You thought if you got us thrown out,no one could prove you didn't design that necklace."

The crowd pressed in.

Violet bristled. "I did design it." She clutched her phone. got the original drafts to prove it. You're not stealing my work!"

My eyes narrowed.

She could be bluffing, or she really might have the drafts.

As another Nyx Collective designer, Violet had access to other people's drafts. And Savannah had said she wanted to use my necklace sketch as an example for a studio class.

Maybe I'd underestimated Violet. I hadn't thought she'd save a copy on her phone. Had she planned something like this all along?

She held up her phone. "Look! I've got the drafts right here!"

A cluster of guests leaned in. One look at her screen and their suspicion shifted. Suddenly, I was the villain of the party.

Violet's smugness filled the air like cheap perfume.

I didn't react. I just waited.

Waited until she'd shoved her screen under every nose within ten feet.

Then I said, "Good thing you showed everyone. Saved me the trouble."

Her hand wavered. "What do you mean?"

I said to one of the girls inspecting the drafts, "Why don't you zoom in? Check the engraving on those tiny diamonds."
###Chapter 23 The Girlfriend and the Ex


Violet's face twitched. She made a futile grab for the phone.

The girl zoomed in obediently. Her eyes went wide. "There's an M," she blurted. "Tiny, but it's there!"

A ripple went through the crowd.

"That's the designer's signature, right? The M?" someone whispered, loud enough to be not-whispering.

"It says M. Bloody hell, it reallyis Mirabelle's design!"

Violet's face went from ghost-pale to lobster-red in two seconds flat. She snatched her phone back and mashed the power button like she was trying to murder it.

Too late. The whispers were already turning into open laughter. The kind that bites.

"If you're going to stealsaid sweetly,"aleast do it properly."

I took two slow steps forward, stopping just short of her personal space, and gave her necklace a pointed once-over.

My brow furrowed slightly, like I'd just spotted something nasty in my drink. "That piece around your neck shouldn't even be here. It's the prototype-the very first design. And last I checked, that thing was locked behind glass at Nyx Collective's flagship showroom."

I tilted my head and gave her the kind of look reserved for particularly dumb criminals.

"Stealing is really your only talent,huh?"

For half a second, the room froze. You could hear a champagne bubble pop.

Then Yvaine cracked up, loud and savage. "So the necklace's stolen too? Damn, is the Lin family that broke?Can't even afford jewelry anymore?"

Violet looked like she wanted to melt straight through the marble floor. Her face was so red, it practically clashed with the lighting. She fidgeted with the necklace, probably feeling like it was burning a hole through her skin.

I saw the moment she thought about running. She shifted her weight, glanced sideways, just about to bolt-

When the ballroom doors flew open and a fresh wave of noise crashed in.

Rhys Granger had arrived. And standing beside him, looking disgustingly smug in bubblegum pink, was Catherine Vance.

Rhys wore a sharp black suit, cold and expensive like something he'd taken off a mannequin at Dior.Catherine floated next to him, not holding his arm but close enough that they might as well have been glued together.

Murmurs rippled across the room.

"God, they look good together. Perfect match."

"Told you Rhys never liked Mirabelle. Catherine's always been his real choice."

My grin slipped. Just peeled right off mny face.

Seeing them side by side in public hit me. It wasn't heartbreak. It wasn't rage. It was more like reaching for a glass of champagne and tasting dishwater instead.

I knew Rhys too bloody well. He'd planned this.

Louisa was still in the hospital. Which meant she wouldn't see this. Wouldn't hear about it until much later,after the whole social circle had already gotten cozy with the idea of Rhys and Catherine being a thing

By then, Louisa, who hated Catherine with the passion of a thousand suns, would be trapped. Everyone would expect her to accept it.

After I'd refused to keep playing fiancée with him, this was his Plan B.

The plan was slick, sly, and absolutely flthy.

I thought back to the last public event I'd dragged myself to with Rhys.

We'd arrived together, technically, but he peeled off the second we said hi to the hosts. He left me standing there like a coat rack while he spent the night chatting golf swings and table football with his idiot friends.

I should've caught on then. Rhys Granger was never going to love me the way I wanted.

I got it now. The weird glances his friends kept sneaking me at that party weren't about my dress or my hair.
They were pity.

And God, thinking about it stffl máde my throat burn. Like swaflowing glass.

I blinked hard, shoved it down, and dragged Yvaine away.

Yvaine threw a death glare over her shoulder. Then she said, very loudly, "Imagine bringing your side chick to such a party. Some people have thicker skin than a concrete bunker."

Catherine stomped up to us, blocking my path.

"Mira," she said, flashing this tragic, I'm-so-sorry face, "I didn't know you'd be here. Rhys and I just got together to talk about work, and then he said he didn't have a date,so he asked me to come."

I stared at her.

"Right. Total coincidence. Is that why you're dressed like a Valentine's Day massacre?" I flicked my fingers at her sparkly pink gown. "That your usual work outfit now?"

Catherine blinked. It hit her a second too late that I wasn't playing nice anymore.

She used to have me pegged. Sweet, soft, desperate for Rhys's approval. I used to put up with anything for a chance that he'd look at me twice.

Not tonight.

Catherine clutched her hands so tight I could see the blood drain from her knuckles. Her eyes went glassy fast, like she was about to start sobbing on cue.

"It's all my fault," she said, voice trembling. "I shouldn't have come with Rhys. Please don't be mad."

Before I could tell her where to shove her apology, Rhys strolled over. He took one look at Catherine and immediately switched into Knight-in-Shining-Dumbass mode.

His gaze flicked to me. For a splitsecond, something flared in his eyes-surprise, maybe even a hint of regret-but he snuffed it out quick, like it was illegal to look impressed by me now.

"Mira, don't start," he said sharply. "I brought her. It's on me."

I smirked. "I'm not starting anything. She's the one fake-crying like it's open-mic night."

Rhys didn't believe a word of it. He shot me a warning glare, grabbed Catherine's wrist, and yanked her away.

Yvaine flashed hls back a very enthusiastic middle finger.

"Think he's just flaunting Catherine to piss me off?" I said, reaching for a drink I didn't even want.

Yvaine snorted. "Partly, yeah. But mostly? He's here to sniff around the Laurents. My brother heard half this bloody room's trying to cozy up to the young heir tonight."

"Emmett told you that?" | asked.

She nodded. "Straight from the horse's mouth. Clive Granger was supposed to show up himself, but he's stuck at the hospital with Louisa. So he shoved golden boy out the door instead."

Something Catherine had said earlier kept nagging at me. "Wait. Are Catherine and Rhys... working together now?"
 ###Chapter 24 Violent SOB


Yvaine suddenly found the floor fascinating. Her heels. A smudge on the carpet. Anything but my face.

"Yvaine," I said, sharper this time. "You know all the gossip in town. Spill."

She winced. "I didn't want to tell you. Thought it might... I don't know. Upset you."

"Trust me," I said. "The only thing that could upset me right now is running out of alcohol."

Yvaine gave a guilty little shrug. "Fine. Yeah. They're working together. Catherine's his secretary now."

For a second, I thought I hadn't heard her right. "Secretary? Like... scheduling and stuff?"

"Yeah."

I barked out a laugh, way too loud for a party this fancy. A few people glanced over. I didn't care.

Back when Rhys and I were a thing, I needed to book an appointment just to swing by his office with a sandwich.

Now Catherine, whose only organizational skill was getting thrown out of a club in under ten minutes, got an all-access pass?

"Of course she is," I said, grabbing another drink off the tray of a passing waiter. bloody course."

Yvaine quickly changed the subject. "Why don't we go say hi to the Van Astors? Their son runs a boutique fashion label. Might be a chance for you to collab."

I nodded and followed her across the room. Business before drama. Always.

But apparently, Catherine didn't share that thought.

I had just sealed a handshake deal with Whitman Van Astor to look at my new designs-my jewelry line might even end up in his next spring launch-when she came back, dragging Serenna Oakley behind her.

I'd clocked Serenna the second she slithered in. Looked like Catherine had pulled some strings to get her an invite.

God knew when those two got so chummy, though. Last I checked, Serenna was still slagging off Catherine's taste in shoes.

Serenna flashed a smug little grin at me. "Bet you didn't expect to see me at the Laurent party,humh?"

I gave her a once-over. Designer dress, borrowed confidence, and a face that said 'please validate me.

I turned to Catherine. "You might wanna be careful. Our dear cousin's been obsessed with Rhys since school. You sure you wanna parade him around with her sniffing after him?"

Catherine's face stiffened. She snapped her head towards Serenna, eyes sharp enough to shave an eyebrow clean off.

Serenna went the color of a bad spray tan. "Don't listen to her! She thinks every girl on the planet's gagging for Rhys."

"And you're one of them," I said, all helpful-like.

"No I'm not! Not anymore!"

"Huh." I raised an eyebrow. "You've got a new target then? Who is it?"

Serenna flailed for a second, then swung towards Catherine."Cathy,swear down, I don't have a thing for Rhys.I know you two are meant to be."

Catherine wavered, chewing over whether to trust Serenna or not, before she gave a stiff little nod."|believe you."

Then she turned to me. "This is an important party for Rhys. I hope you won't ruin it."

I crossed my arms. "Trust me, Catherine, I've got nothing more to do with him. Whether this is the best night of his life or he trips over a napkin and dies of embarrassment, I couldn't care less."

Her smile wobbled but she pressed on. "I know you're bitter, but please, be reasonable. There are a lot of business elites here tonight. Rhys is trying to secure an investment deal with the Laurents. Please don't let your personal feelings ruin this chance for him."

"My personal feelings? You mean you don't want me to broadcast the fact that I dumped Rhys because he's a violent little SOB who hasn't got the spine to tell his mother he's in love with someone else? Instead, he just rolls over and accepts a fiancée he never wanted, because having an actual conversation might be too scary for him? Yeah, I can see how that wouldn't reafly help his investment pitch."

Serenna glanced between us, eyes wide, clearly realizing that there was way more dirt under this rug than anyone had warned her about.

Catherine had the grace to blush, but not the good sense to back off."Whatever happened," she said, voice tight, "you and I are stil family. And Rhys will be family too. So please, don't do anything you'll regret."

I rolled my eyes so hard it was a miracle | could still see straight.

There was no point trying to explain it to her. In Catherine's mind, I was still the pathetic little fangirl who used to trail after Rhys like a lost puppy. Nothing I said would change that.

So I turned to leave.

I barely made it two steps before I caught a shift in the air behind me, then that overpowering floral cloud Catherine called perfume hit my nose.

A split second later, her heel clipped the back of my ankle.

I pitched forward, barely catching myself before I faceplanted.

Before I could turn around, she yanked the long white tablecloth with both hands. Drinks, cakes, fancy canapé towers-all of it crashed to the floor in one glorious, sticky mess.

The entire ballroom snapped to attention.Heads whipped around so fast, I swear I heard a few necks crack.

And right on cue, Serenna threw herself into the spotlight like she'd rehearsed for it."Oh no! Mirabelle just trashed the party! She's ruining everything!"

The words had barely left her mouth before there was a loud smack.

I shook out my stinging hand. "You tore the tablecloth off and tried to pin it on me. You think I'm blind?"

Catherine clutched her cheek. "It wasn't me! It was you! You pulled it by accident... I swear..."

Yvaine snapped out of her shock and delivered a slap of her own, this one right across Serenna's pretty little face. "You really thought that stupid stunt would work? You think everyone here's as thick as you?"

Serenna screeched. "How dare you hit me! I saw it with my own eyes-Mirabelle ruined the party on purpose!"
She grabbed a random glass of wine off the wreckage and aimed it at Yvaine's face.

I lunged to block it, but the wine still splashed down Yvaine's shoulder, soaking half her dress.

I had been holding back all night. I really had.

But that was it.

grabbed Serenna by the hair and yanked. "Go on. Try throwing another drink. See what happens."

Serenna howled like a dying cat, scrabbling at my hands.

Catherine tried to rush over to help her, but Yvaine blocked her with a shove.

You want a scene?" Yvaine said, wild-eyed and grinning. "Fine. Let's give 'em a bloody show."
###Chapter 25 Ashton's POV: Gladiator Style


"So who's the poor girl you've tricked into getting engaged to you without telling anyone?" Regínald demanded. "The least you can do is introduce her."⑤

Reginald Laurent. Ashton's biological father. Walking proof that money couldn't buy competence.

He looked the part-mid-forties, still in decent shape, sharp enough jawline-but inside? Empty.

Everyone in Skyline City knew old man Edouard, king of Laurent Global Holdings, would rather set fire to his empire than hand Reginald the keys.

The guy didn't have the grit. Never had.

Maybe Reginald knew it too. Maybe that was why he spent most of his time punching down, taking out his insecurities on people who couldn't punch back. Like young Ashton.

Once upon a time, Ashton used to care. Used to wonder why his father treated him like something scraped off a shoe.

But those days were dead and buried.

Ashton didn't even look up from his laptop. He had a conference call with London, Paris, and Frankfurt in two minutes. Reginald barging in, as usual, wasn't enough to break his focus.

"She's here at the party. You'll meet her soon enough,"' Ashton said, voice flat.

"But, Ash, what your father means is, we don't know anything about her," Gwendolyn Laurent chimed in."I mean, sure, we know her name and that she's a...' Her mouth twisted like she was chewing glass, "a barista. But are you sure this is the right match? You need a wife who can handle the mayor's galas, investor dinners, charity auctions. Is a barista really going to survive in our world?"

Ashton finally looked up, pinning her with a stare.

There it was. Fake concern, real agenda.

Gwendolyn wasn't worried about his sudden engagement. She was thrilled.

Ashton marrying a 'nobody' meant her precious son, Declan, might actually stand a chance. In her twisted day/dreams, Declan wasn't just going to inherit Laurent Global Holdings, he was going to snatch Titanova Corp out from under Ashton too.

Ashton shut his laptop with a click.

"Whether she's up to the job is none of your concern. And I didn't ask for your worthless opinion."

Reginald's nostrils flared. "She's your mother! Show some respect!"

"Step-mother," Ashton said, dragging out the first syllable like he was scrubbing it with sandpaper."And while we're on the subject, I didn't ask for yours, either."'

He hit the intercom. "Gareth. Get them out. Whoever let them in-dock his pay for three months."

"Yes, boss,"' came Gareth Stone's dry reply.

Thirty seconds later, the head of Ashton's security detail walked in.

"Mr. and Mrs. Laurent," Gareth said, holding out an arm. "This way, please."'

Reginald opened his mouth like he was about to argue, then caught the look in Ashton's eyes and thought better of it.

The moment the study door closed, Ashton patched through his international call.

Titanova Corp usually ran like a well-oiled machine, but certain things-like shady local governments and militia groups who thought bribes were a national sport-still needed his personal attention.

Half an hour later, he wrapped up the call, adjusted his suit with a sharp tug, and was about to head downstairs when Dominic Everett, his assistant,hurried in.

"She here?" Ashton asked,already knowing the answer.

Dominic, used to Ashton's one-track mind where Mirabelle Vance was concerned, nodded. "Miss Vance has arrived."' Hehesitated, then added, "But there's been an... incident."

"Spit it out."
"She's... ah, fighting someone in the ballroom. As in, actual fistfight. Not a verbal argument."

Ashton's jaw tightened. His entire expression darkened like someone had switched off the lights inside him.

He brushed past Dominic without a word and stormed towards the stairs.

Cassian Langford, looking half-asleep and rubbing his face like he'd just lost a brawl with his pillow, caught up to him.

"What's all the noise downstairs?"' he asked, voice stilI scratchy.

When his friend didn't answer, Cassian jogged after Ashton but almost crashed into his back when Ashton abruptly stopped at the landing.

Following Ashton's line of sight, Cassian peered down.

"Bloody hell,"' he muttered, eyes widening. "When you invited me to the party, I didn't know it was going to be gladiator-style."

The ballroom was chaos. Guests scrambled back, forming a rough ring around the brewing disaster in the center.

Ashton recognized Mirabelle's friend Yvaine, who'd just kicked Catherine square in the gut. Not hard enough to do real damage-she was in a dress that was more for show than combat-but it was enough to block Catherine from throwing herself in front of Serenna like a discount bodyguard.

Catherine seized her moment. Tears poured down her face like someone had flipped a switch.

"Mira, I was only trying to help," she sobbed. "You pulled the tablecloth and knocked over the buffet by accident. I was just helping you pick up the pieces. Why would you hit me? And Serenna was only trying to help,too!"

A few of her cronies, already planted at the party like bad weeds, caught her frantic glances. They rushed over to back her up.

"You can't just go around hitting people!"' one of them screeched.
"Yeah, what the hell? This isn't a bloody food market!"' another barked, full Karen mode activated.

Yvaine, scrappy but outnumbered, started looking boxed in.

Before Ashton could even blink, Mirabelle moved. She stormed up, grabbed Catherine by the hair like she was yanking weeds, and slammed her halfway to the marble floor.

"Don't think I don't know what you're pulling. You set this whole thing up, didn't you?"

Her fingers twisted harder. Catherine whimpered. Mirabelle didn't let up. With her other hand, she still had a death grip on Serenna.

Screams and curses bounced around the room. Everyone else was freaking out.

Ashton didn't see any of it.

He only saw her.

He stood on the stairs, fists clenching, watching Mirabelle-tiny, furious, unstoppable-pinning two grown women like it was nothing.

Her arms looked slim, but damn, she was strong. Catherine and Serenna couldn't even lift their heads.

Mirabelle held herself like a queen. Her spine was straight, her chin tipped back slightly, the diamonds around her neck catching the chandeliers and tossing the light back like a thousand tiny knives.

She made dragging two idiots across a ballroom look... weirdly attractive.

"Why are you grinning like an idiot?" Cassian pointed at Ashton's face. "Does a catfight turn you on?"

Ashton touched his face. He hadn't even realized he was smiling.

But how could he not, when it was Mirabelle?

He had been wrong. Mirabelle didn't need rescuing.

She was feisty, fearless, never-let-them-take-an-inch Mirabelle.

Soon-to-be-his Mirabelle.
###Chapter 26 His Real Name


Chaos was breaking out, but Yvaine wasn't exactly losing. She'd landed a kick on everyone who came near,even knocked one guy flat on his arse.

"All those kickboxing classes are finally paying off." She even had the time to gloat to me.

I nodded at her.

That was when Rhys finally decided to show up, fresh from whatever mirror he'd been admiring himself in.

He took one look at the scene and his face went from "Skyline City heartthrob" to "incoming category/five hurricane" in half a second.

"Mirabelle! What the hell are you doing? If you're pissed off, take it out on me! Leave Catherine out of it!"he snapped, storming towards me.

Moving fast, he grabbed my wrist, trying to yank my hand out of Catherine's hair.

But I wasn't letting go.

"You stay out of it!" I snapped, tightening my grip. "You just assume it's my fault without even asking,yeah?"

"You're literally dragging Catherine around by her hair! Am I supposed to pretend I'm blind?"

The room was full of Skyline's top-tier elite-the type of people Rhys used to stalk on Linkedln and now desperately wanted to impress. His ego must've been melting faster than an ice cream on a July pavement.

So, naturally, he took it out on me, yanking my arm so hard I thought my bones would snap.

I barely had time to swear before a hand clamped down on Rhys's arm. Hard.

Rhys stiffened. "Who the hell-?"

Ashton ripped Rhys's hand off me like peeling gum off a shoe and took hold of my wrist."Come with me."

The way he was glaring at Rhys, you'd think he was two seconds away from breaking every bone in his hand.
I glanced down. A bright red mark was blooming across my wrist like some godawful brand. Fantastic. Just what I needed-battle scars from my ex.

Ashton saw it too. His eyes narrowed. He shot Rhys a look so cold it could've frozen the Hudson. Rhys actually flinched, breaking into a nervous sweat.

He just stood there, dumb as a lamppost, while Ashton led me upstairs without a word.

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted some guy in a suit storming towards Yvaine, with a swarm of security guards on his heels.

"Let go of me! Not my fault!" Yvaine shrieked. "Everyone saw it! Rhys has been cheating, parading his side chick around like it's spring break, and they ganged up on Mira! The wedding's off! And it's not Mira's fault she's bailing-it's because Rhys is a lying piece of shit!"

"I need to get to my friend," I said.

"She'll be fine," Ashton said curtly.

I saw the guy in the suit barking orders at the guards, waving them towards the knot of people crowding Yvaine. They waded in, peeling the mob off her.

Yvaine was still on her feet, looking pissed but perfectly fine.

Ashton added, "They're coming this way. Don't worry, your friend's fine."

No time to argue. His grip on my wrist was firm but not rough, dragging me into a side room that looked like a private lounge.

Seconds later, the suit came barging in, hauling Yvaine by the arm.

He raked a hand through his immaculately groomed hair and barked at her,"Right. Start talking. What the hell happened?"

Yvaine grabbed a napokin and started dabbing at her wine-soaked dress. She launched into a play-by-play of the mess downstairs.

While she ranted, Ashton brought out a med kit, his hand surprisingly gentle as he dabbed antiseptic on my wrist. His touch was careful,almost...reverent.

The iodine burned slightly.
Not that it was the worst part. The real problem was how bloody close he was. Ashton was half-kneeling in front of me, breath ghosting over my skin, and between the sting and the heat of him, my whole arm was ready to catch fire.

His eyes flicked over me, sharp and thorough, like he was scanning for damage. I felt stripped bare.

I yanked my hand back and shrugged like it was no big deal. "I'm fine, really. I box, you know. If it had come down to it, those girls wouldn't have stood a chance."

Ashton pushed himself upright, grabbed his phone, and made a call. When it connected, he said, "Pull the security footage from the first floor."

I checked on Yvaine, blotting at the giant wine stain on her designer dress. The guy in the suit hovered nearby,passing me tissues like he was trying to make himself useful.

"That dress is a goner," he said. "I'll tell the housekeeper to bring you a fresh one."

Yvaine waved it off. "The dress is fine. If you hadn't dragged me off, I swear I would've roasted Rhys into a permanent meme!"

Then she shot me an apologetic wince and said, "Mira, about me yelling the whole engagement's off in public-you're not mad, right? It just sort of...slipped out."

I shrugged. "I'm not mad."

Then I looked over at Ashton. "I didn't realise you'd arrived. You were upstairs this whole time?"

Even when fists were flying and glasses were smashing, I hadn't missed it. Ashton had appeared from the second floor, not the front entrance.

Ashton hesitated.

Before he could say anything, the guy in the suit cut in, "Why can't he be upstairs? He lives here."

I blinked at Ashton. "You live here?"

Yvaine butted in too, eyes flicking between the guy in the suit and Ashton."Wait, you two know each other?"

The guy nodded. "Duh. We've been friends for ages. That's Ashton Laurent. Just got back from Europe.This whole party's for him."
I nearly fell over. "Ashton Laurent? You told me your name was Ashton Girard!"

At the same time, Yvaine screeched too: "Ashton? Mira, this is your new fiancé?"

Ashton, calm as a dead heart monitor, said to mne, "Girard's my mum's surname. Laurent's my dad's."

His friend's jaw hit the floor. "Wait, what? You're engaged?"

Ashton side-eyed him. "This party is to announce it. Didn't you get the memo?"
###Chapter 27 Complicated


My brain was doing somersaults.

I knew the Laurents were throwing this party, but I'd thought Ashton was just a guest, not the bloody host himself.

Ashton hadn't exactly lied to me, but neither had he told me the full truth.

Then something his friend had said earlier lit up in my head, and I circled back, "If this is your house, why the hell did you rent the flat opposite mine at Oakwood Apartments?"

Ashton looked me dead in the eye."Oakwood's my company's development. The whole building's mine. I stay there sometimes."

"That's how you knew l'd moved there. I'm your... tenant."

He nodded.

Another memory struck me. "And La Vache Dorée? You own that restaurant too?"

He nodded.

"And the bar?" Damn it, I couldn't even remember its name. "The one where we... the night we..."

Another nod.

My emotions were doing the cha-cha.Badly.

Since the day I met him, Ashton had given off a dangerous aura- not murderer-dangerous, more like apex-predator dangerous. The height, the build, the lethal arms that looked like they could punch through drywall,the unreadable eyes- you'd have to be suicidal not to flinch.

And yet.

He'd picked up my keys when I dropped them and driven halfway across the city to return them.

He'd gone along with my drunken, desperate one-night-stand plan without a flicker of judgement.
He'd even offered to fake an engagement to help me get my pushy parents off my back.

Somewhere in my idiot brain, I'd filed him under "dangerous but good-hearted."

Now, though, knowing he literally owned half of Skyline City and more, the pressure crushed down on me like a hydraulic press.

I didn't know what I felt.

Shock,sure.

But it was more than that.

It was like thinking you'd adopted a scrappy little kitten, only to realize you'd been cuddling a bloody tiger.

The room went dead silent.

Then Yvaine mumbled, "I, ah, I can't wear this. I need to change. Cas, come with me."

She grabbed the man's arm and bolted out of the room.

"I'll put the first-aid kit back," Ashton said, disappearing into the en suite bathroom.

I heard Yvaine's voice outside:"Why the hell didn't you tell me he was Ashton Laurent?"

The man she called Cas shot back, "How was I supposed to know you'd met him before? And why are you dragging me off? I haven't even asked about the bloody engagement yet!"

"Did you not hear? They're engaged."

"No way! Ashton's been in love with someone for years. What's this engagement bullshit?"

"What? What someone? Who is it? Spit it out-"

Their voices faded as they stormed down the hall.

I sat there, the echoes of their argument fizzing through my skull.

"Complicated" did not even begin to cover it.

If what Ashton's friend said was true, that he was in love with someone else, why'd he agree to be fake-engaged to me?
I heard the footsteps before I saw them.

Rhys shoved the door open. "Mirabelle! Have you lost your bloody mind? Apologize to Catherine! And that idiot bestie of yours, yelling about you calling off the engagement, embarrassing me in front of the whole city! Was that your idea?"

I tilted my head, brows pulling tight. I'd just managed to cool off, but Rhys's voice was like lighter fluid on a barbecue.

"Rhys," I said sweetly,"we're already done. Yvaine was just telling the truth."

"We're not done unless I say we're done!" He scowled.talk about that later. Catherine's face is swollen thanks to you. Don't you feel the tiniest bit guilty?"

Behind him, Catherine clung to his sleeve like a human handkerchief.

"I'm fine," she said in a tiny voice. "If she doesn't want to apologize to me, whatever. But she should apologize to the Laurents. The ballroom's a total mess now. The party's basically ruined before it even began."

Rhys gave her hand a patronizing pat, then turned back to me. "Cathy's right. You need to apologize to the Laurents.Publicly. Immediately. Or I'll-"

The words had barely left his mouth when the bathroom door behind me swung open.

Ashton strode past me, planting himself right in Rhys's face. "She's not apologizing to anyone."

Rhys blinked at him, thrown off for half a second.

I could see the wheels in his brain creaking under the weight.

He'd seen Ashton downstairs earlier, thought he looked familiar, but couldn't place him.

In his tiny little mind, that meant one thing: I'd picked up some random loser.

Rhys's nostrils flared. He looked Ashton up and down like he was some discount handbag.

"And who the fuck are you supposed to be?"

I couldn't see Ashton's face, but he must have done something that made Rhys stiffen.
"This is the Laurent family's turf!" Rhys gulped, his voice cracking. "You've got no say here. And whatever's going on between me and Mirabelle is none of your damn business either. If you've got half a brain, you'll get lost."

Ashton took half a step forwvard.

Rhys flinched and staggered back before he even knew what he was doing.

Before anyone could throw a punch, someone knocked once and pushed the door open. "Boss, I got the footage."

Footage?

I saw Rhys'sright eyelid twitching like crazy, and judging by the way he was suddenly sweating through his shirt, he was about to have a very bad day.

"Boss?What...?"

Then I saw realization dawn in his eyes.

I caught Rhys giving Ashton a double take.

For a second, I almost pitied him. Almost.

Rhys opened his mouth, probably about to dig himself even deeper, but Catherine jumped in first,her voice trembling."W-what footage?"

Ashton didn't even spare her a glance. He was busy watching the tablet the newcomer handed to him, his face carved from pure ice.

"Put it up on the main screen," he said. "First floor. Play it on loop. Full volumne."

"Got it, boss." The man nodded and spoke into his earpiece.
###Chapter 28 Footage


Thirty seconds later, the giant screen in the center of the ballroom lit up, crystal-clear like some Hollywood premiere,every detail sharp enough to catch the sweat prickling on Catherine's arms.

From where I stood near the open door, I had the perfect view of the disaster unfolding downstairs.

Rhys whipped around to stare at Catherine. "You said Mirabelle was stirring up trouble, pulling the tablecloth and trying to pin it on you. So explain to me why, in that footage, it's your hand yanking the cloth,and Mira's nowhere near it?"

Catherine burst into tears on cue, shaking so hard her diamond earrings rattled. She stammered for ages,blubbering, "Maybe I, I tugged it by accident? Mirabelle kept provoking me, and I panicked, I thought..."

No one was buying it.

Catherine grabbed Rhys's sleeve. "Rhys, I didn't mean to cause trouble! Mirabelle set me off!"

Ashton cut in, "Miss Vance, the cameras record audio too. If you insist on your innocence, I can have them pull the full footage from when you arrived. Let's all hear exactly how Mirabelle 'provoked' you, shall we?"

"No!" Catherine yelped.

She shut up after that, probably realizing no amount of ugly crying was going to spin this train wreck.

Her mascara was sliding down her face in greasy black rivers, but Rhys wasn't even looking at her anymore.

He stood there, breathing like he wanted to strangle someone, before forcing himself to calm down.

I could smell the regret sweating off him. He was probably wishing he could go back five minutes and take back every stupid thing he had said to Ashton.

Finally, in a voice so stiff it could snap in half, Rhys muttered, "Catherine made a... a mnistake. She didn't mean to wreck the party. It was... an impulsive lapse of judgment. Catherine, apologize to Mr... Laurent.Now."

Catherine's eyes widened at Ashton's name. She stared at Rhys in disbelief, then at Ashton. Then, finally,like Rhys, she understood.
Then she scrambled to throw out a million "sorry's"in Ashton's direction.

He cut her off, voice like a blade: "You're apologizing to the wrong person."

Catherine froze. Her gaze slid to me.

Yeah. I was the one she needed to grovel to. And judging by her twisted face, she'd rather eat glass than say sorry to me.

"I..." she stammered, the words choking in her throat.

"Looks like Miss Vance isn't exactly drowning in remorse," Ashton said, flashing a look at the doorway.

Cue the bouncers. Two guys in black suits stormed in and grabbed Catherine by both arms.

She barely had time to blink before they started dragging her towards the staircase.

"Wait! I'm sorry! I'll apologize! Mirabelle, I'm sorry!" she howled, flailing desperately.

The guys didn't even slow down.

Ashton watched her with all the emotion of a marble statue. "Too late."

"Rhys! Help me!" Catherine shrieked, kicking her heels against the floor.

Rhys twitched like he was about to sprint after her, but stopped dead when Ashton said, "Walk out now, Mr.Granger, and you make her cause yours. Your name on tonight's mess. And your name on the Laurent family's blacklist. Is that what you want?"

"No! I swear, I didn't know anything!" Rhys blurted.

For a second, I thought he might still throw himself at the door.

Instead, he just looked at Catherine-screaming, heels scraping over marble-and then looked away.

He had never looked so cowardly.

Rhys shuffled over to Ashton, fake smile stretched so tight it looked painful. "Mr. Laurent, I actually came here tonight to discuss a potential deal with LGH. I'd never dream of causing trouble at your party. If y/ou might have a moment...?"

He was actually bowing. The desperation stank.
Ashton didn't even look up. He lounged in the armchair, scrolling his phone like Rhys was background noise.

The silent treatment hit harder than a slap. Rhys's face was a shade of red I'd never seen before.

Finally, he gave up trying to talk business and leaned toward me instead, whispering, "When did you meet Mr.Laurent?"

I shrugged. "That's none of your business. Now scram."

His jaw ticked. "Since you know Mr. Laurent... maybe you could, you know, put in a good word later? I've got a project I want to pitch."

I shot him a look. "And what's that got to do with me?"

He reached for my hand. Tight enough to be annoying, not tight enough to leave a mark. "Come on, even if we're broken up, we're still friends, right? We grew up together, after all. Besides, whether I marry you or your sister, we'd still end up as family. Our interests align, don't you see?"

Sometimes the sheer stupidity of men is so overwhelming you have no choice but to laugh.①

I snorted right in his face.

"Rhys Granger, even if we were still together-which, newsflash, we're not-you think I'd give a damn about your family's business? Our interests align? I don't see my name on your company's stock certificates. You lot could be rolling in gold bars, and I stil wouldn't see a penny. Why should I help you?"

Rhys opened his mouth, then thought better of it.

Smart for once.

I yanked my hand free and snatched a tissue off the table, scrubbing my wrist like I was wiping off a cockroach.

His face twisted. It took him some moments before he found speech again.

"I know you're still pissed about... the fight," he said, pretending to sound all reasonable."How about this?I'm free tomorrow. I'll take you out shopping. Maybe pick a wedding dress."

He glanced at Ashton, then lowered his voice. "The invites are already printed. The wedding's happening,Mira. You can kick and scream all you want, but it's not getting canceled. Not till my mom...you know."
I just stared at him.

Apparently tired of talking to a brick wall, Rhys grabbed my arm and started dragging me towards the door."Let's talk outside."e

"Stop." Ashton looked up from his phone. "Miss Vance is my guest. You can leave. She stays."

Translation:get lost,loser.
 ###Chapter 29 Repercussions


Rhys, shocker, actually took the hilnt and left.

Silence dropped over the room llke à heavy curtáin.

I knew Ashton hed fust gone full Oladiator mode for me.

Which was... weirdly touching, considering we were basically strangers who just happened to have a fake engagement contract and three awkward encounters under our belts.

"Thanks for that," I mumbled.

Ashton shrugged. "Don't thank me. He was pissing me off."

He stood up, his gaze flicking to my wrist where Rhys's Neanderthal grip had left faint marks. He frowned.

My phone started screaming.

Caroline's name lit up the screen like a warning siren.

Yeah,no thanks.

I hit decline without blinking.

Five seconds later, the phone started ringing again. Persistent as a debt collector.

Sighing,I stabbed the answer button and held it to my ear."What?"

I barely got the word out before a full-on banshee shriek exploded from the speaker.

"Mirabelle! How dare you hit your sister in front of everyone at the party?!"

Ah.Serenna or Catherine must have run to mummy dearest with their version of events.

For a second, I thought about explaining. Telling her how Serenna started it, how Catherine had been stirring the pot.

But then... What was the point? Caroline would believe them over me if they told her the sky was green and pigs had started UberEats deliveries.
stayod quiet, fust holdirig thie phone to my ear wis ahie shoutact, feellng absolutely nothing-

"Cothorno's barely back l Skytile and trying to rejoln trie soclak scene, and you humillated her in front of everyone! She fhally got an thvite to a major party, aney you wrecked RE There's video foofage, Mira, video!It's evorywhere! How do you expect us to save face now? Hlow's the Granger famlly supposed to gave face?If you've got even a shred of decency left, you'm drag your arse home, apologize to Cathering, then haul yourself over to the Grangers and grovel. You want to throw tantrums? Fine. But don't drag the rest of us down with you!”

I glanced at my watch. She managed that two-minute rant without stopping to breathe. A personal best,even for her.

It sounded like she'd been waiting for an excuse to lose it on me, like this was her big comeback tour after the last time I refused to play ball.

My phone wash't even on speaker, but Ashton, sitting not five feet away, must have caught every word.

The screaming from Caroline's end was still going strong when my screen lit up with another call.

Aunt Louisa.

I cut in mid-rant:"Mum, you've been talking for so long you must be parched. Go grab a water bottle before you croak. I've got another call. Gotta run."

Then I hung up.

The phone started buzzing again. Louisa.

I stared at it, jaw tight.

Blowing off Rhys was easy.

Louisa, not so much.

She was in the hospital recovering from a car accident that I was partially responsible for, and she'd been nothing but kind to me my whole life.

Birthday parties, scraped knees, family fights-Aunt Louisa had been there for all of it.

She was probably calling because she'd heard about the mess at the party. Everyone else had.
And I had nothing for her. 1 didry'y want to the to Her And* wasn't my lob to cover for her áon's dumpater-fire tove fife.

The screen went dark. Stralght to volcemat.

Ashton shlfted next to mo, looking tke he wanted to say something

Hts phone went off before he could. He picked up.

"Got tt," he sald after a minute, then hung up and looked át mé.

I frowned."What?"

"That was my assistant. Loulsa Granger just collapsed at the hospital. They're trying to bring her around."

was on my feet before he finished. I looked at the door, then back at him, frozen for half a beat.

Ashton didn't miss a thing."Let's go."

"But the party-"

"The guests can entertain themselves. They're grown-ups."

didn't argue. Just threw him a quick, grateful smile and we were off.

***

Eldergrove Private loomed up like a ghost I really didn't want to meet again.

Last time I'd been here... yeah, not the best memnory.

I shoved it down and stormed inside, zeroing in on the nurses' station.

A couple of barked directions later, I found Louisa's room.

Willow Granger stood posted like a bouncer at the door, arms folded.

Her dad, Clive Granger, was slumped on a chair to the side, staring at thefloor.

I walked straight up. "Aunt Louisa, how is she?"

Willow turned. The second she saw my face, her expression twisted like she'd swallowed battery acid.
She didn'1 say a word. She fust swung.

Tho slap canio rast trd ugly, isut tiot tast enourgy

1 blocked ＃ wfh my す배기-6目5y．

Willow stoggered back a stop, surprlsed.

I thought about slapping her back. I really dHd.

But punching Aunt Louisa's daugliter right outside her hospitatroom felt like a bit too much, even for me.

Willow hissed, her voice shaking, "You've got some bloody nerve showing up here. What, trying to finish the job? Want to kill her for good this time?"

I folded my arms and stared her down. "I'm not here to swap insufts. I asked a simple question."

She wasn't listening.

"You trashed the Laurent party tonight so bad the videos are blowing up all over group chats.Everyone's laughing at us, at the Grangers! And you're telling me you didn't mean it?" Her voice cracked with fury. "My mum treated you better than she treats me sometimes-hell, she pretty much raised you like her own-and this is how you pay her back?"

Classic Willow. She'd hated my guts from day one. Thought I wasn't good enough for her big brother Rhys.Not rich enough. Not posh enough. Not educated enough.

According to her, the only thing I brought to the table was my looks.

In her head, I was the stray puppy Rhys was too soft to kick. The hanger-on. The charity case.

But Louisa had made her choice. She liked me. Loved me, even. Treated me like the daughter she probably wished Willow had been.

And now Willow had all the ammo she needed to blame me for Louisa's condition.

She wasn't done,either.

The first slap had failed, so she reared back for a second.
###Chapter 30 Guflt-trip


I didn't even move. Something told mo l dldn'e need to.

Before her palm could come down, a hand shot past my shoulder, clamped down on her wrist,and shoved her backwards.

Willow stumbled, arms flalling for balance.

Her head whipped up, ready to mouth off, but the moment she saw Ashton's face, she faltered.

It was hard to keep swinging when the guy pinning your arm looked like he could snap you in half for blinking the wrong way.

She yanked her hand free with a pathetic little noise. "And who the hell are you?" she barked."Why are you getting in the way? You..."

Her voice got quieter the longer Ashton stared her down.

Willow shifted from foot to foot, tried to size him up, then her eyes flicked to me and to the jacket hanging off my shoulders. "That's his coat, right? Your new boyfriend?"

She folded her arms, sneering. "When did you start sneaking around behind my brother's back, huh? You go on about Rhys cheating, but look at you! Wearing some random guy's jacket like a badge of honor."

"I don't have to explain myself to you, Willow. You know damn well Rhys and Iare over."

She flapped a hand at me like I was a bad smell. "Save it. Get out."

I planted my feet. "I'm staying till Aunt Louisa wakes up."

Willow's face twisted. "You're not wanted here!"

From the corner of my eye, I caught Clive Granger standing up from his chair. He took his sweet time crossing the short distance between us.

He was pissed too. No surprise there. In his head, I'd practically murdered his wife.

But at least he kept his loathing on a leash, unlike Willow.
Clive stopped a few feet from me and said, all fake-polite, "Louisa's sick because of you. You breaking off the engagement has really hurt her. Shocked her into a heart attack. I don't think she wants to see you when she wakes up.Best you leave now."

I kept my chin up. "Uncle Clive, whether she wants to see me or not is her decision. Not yours."

His jaw twitched, just a little. Before he could spit something back, Ashton cut in,rabelle staying won't disturb anyone. She's worried about Mrs. Granger's health. Let her stay till Mrs. Granger wakes up."

Clive's eyes narrowed. "And you are?"

Ashton reached out, offering his hand. "Ashton Laurent. Nice to meet you, Mr. Granger."

For a second, Clive just stared at Ashton's hand like it was a snake about to bite him. Then he shook it hesitantly. "Mr... Mr. Laurent... Um, thank you for coming. I appreciate your concern, but..." He glanced at me. "You may not know the full story here. It's complicated. Mirabelle-"

"I know enough," Ashton cut him off. "I was at the party too. I saw everything. Mirabelle and Rhys Granger have been done for a while. Besides, Rhys showed up tonight flashing a new girlfriend like a trophy.Mirabelle asking to end the engagement was the polite part. She didn't even say half of what she could have. Honestly, she gave Rhys and the whole Granger family a hell of a lot more dignity than they deserved."

Clive looked like he was about to argue, but Ashton just kept going.

"It's the twenty-first century. Are the Grangers still playing medieval lord and vassal? Treating Mirabelle like she's some mail-order bride? Or maybe Rhys thinks he's got royal blood, getting engaged to Mira while juggling a side chick? What's next, a crown and a sceptre?"

I could have kissed Ashton right there. Maybe even married him.

Clive's face went from tired to full-on corpse grey. "It's not that she can't break it off," he mumbled. "But...Rhys... he's just made a mistake, is all. But that doesn't mean Mirabelle should have broken off the engagement so rashly. Especially not in public like that. Marriage isn't a joke. Louisa was..."-he glanced at me with something halfway between guilt and accusation-"very shocked. And sad."

I took a step forward, but Ashton gave my arm a soothing pat.

"You're right. Marriage isn't a joke. That's exactly why Mirabelle ended it when she realized Rhys wasn't taking it seriously. He violated the whole point of it by parading around another woman while he claimed to still be engaged to Mirabelle."

Clive's mouth opened, but Ashton continued before he could get a word in.

"If infidelity isn't a strong enough reason to call off an engagement,what is?"

The room felt like it was holding its breath.

"And what are you suggesting, Mr. Granger? That Mirabelle should have smiled, swallowedit, and walked down the aisle anyway? Sacrificed her happiness just to keep you and your wife from losing face? What do you take her for-a tool to polish up your family image?"

Clive flinched, but Ashton wasn't done.

"And blaming your wife's heart attack on her? That's low. Guilt-tripping her into resuming the engagement?Even lower."

Clive's mouth worked soundlessly for a second. He looked like he wanted to disappear into the floor.

"I... You're right," he finally muttered. "It's not Mirabelle's fault."

"Then maybe ease up on your attitude. From where I'm standing, you lot are coming off petty and downright unreasonable."

Clive nodded lamely. "Yes, yes, we were... too hasty. If Mirabelle wants to stay and wait for Louisa to wake up, she's welcome to."

Just like that, the tension cracked and fizzled out.

We ended up sitting around outside the operating theatre, all awkward and chilly.

I sat on one end, Willow and Clive huddled at the other, the gap between us wider than four lanes.

I owed Ashton a lot. Words like "thank you" felt lame and hollow, so I swallowed them down.

Ashton hadn't been gone five minutes before he came striding back, a paper bag dangling from his hand.

He stopped in front of me, pulled out a cup of coffee, and handed it over."It's cold tonight. Better to have something warm to hold onto."

I took it, the heat seeping into my frozen fingers. "Thanks."
Then ho bont down and fishod out a pant of thurry smopers from the same bag, droppíng fhem neatly at my teél.

He hodded at me, lke, go on then.
 ###Chapter 31 Velvet Glove


I blinked at him, completely thrown off my game for a second, then kicked off my heels and shoved my feet into the slippers. I didn't even realize my feet were hurting until then.

The soft fleece wrapped around my toes, warmth creeping up my legs and coiling somewhere stupid in my chest.My heart was punching against my ribs like it was trying to make a jailbreak.

Ashton tossed a massive blanket over my lap, covering my flimsy drēss.

He leaned in slightly. "If you need anything, shout. I'm just taking a call over there."

Then he disappeared towards the stairwell.

Willow and Clive Granger kept throwing side-eyes my way, their faces flickering between curiosity, doubt,and full-blown suspicion like a glitchy mood carousel.

I ignored them and watched Ashton through the glass as he leaned against the stairwell wall, lighting a cigarette while he talked on the phone.

Every few seconds, he'd tilt his head and glance my way. Like he was making sure I was still breathing. Like he was staying put for me.

By the time the sky outside started to lighten to a miserable grey, the door to the operating theatre finally slid open.

A surgeon walked out, pullng off his gloves. "The patient's stable. We're moving her to a regular ward. She might wake up in a few hours, but be careful-no more shocks, no upsetting news."

A team of nurses wheeled Louisa past us, still unconscious, still pale as hell.

I followed, only to get body-blocked by Willow at the door.

"You're kidding," I muttered under my breath, but she was already pretending I did not exist.

I ended up lurking outside the ward. NJot exactly my finest moment, but I wasn't going to take the doctor's warning lightly.

A few minutes later, Rhys stormed in with Catherine. Both were still in party clothes and looked like they had sprinted all the way here.

Rhys caught sight of me and, of course, went straight for the jugulár.

"My mum's unconscious because of you. Happy now, Mira? If you've got a problem, you take it out on me.What the hell are you playing at, kicking off at her?"

I opened my mouth, ready to tell him exactly where he could shove his self-righteous attitude, but he had already bulldozed past me into the room.

From inside, I heard Willow's whine: "Mum, she's already sent you to the hospital twice! You sure you want to let her do it again?"

I heard her muttering something else, too low to catch.

Then she popped her head out, scowling like it physically hurt her to speak to me."Mum says you can come in."

I shoved past her before she could change her mind.

As soon as I reached the bed, Louisa lifted her hand towards me. She looked weak as hell, pale and small under the blankets, but her grip was fierce when she grabbed mine.

"This isn't your fault, sweetheart. Don't you dare blame yourself. I just lost my head for a second and my old heart didn't handle it too well, that's all."

"Aunt Louisa..." I choked out. Next thing I knew, fat, humiliating tears were spilling down my face.

Louisa turned to glare at everyone else crammed into the room.

"And don't you lot start blaming Mirabelle either. If anyone's to blame, it's Rhys. If he hadn't been out screwing around, Mira wouldn't have been put through half this shit."

She shot a death glare at Catherine, who quickly ducked behind Rhys.

Louisa's eyes swung back to me. "Mirabelle, I know Rhys hurt you, but you've loved him since you were little. You told me yourself that marrying him has always been your dream. You're like a daughter to me.I don't want to see you left with no one to lean on. Especially with... your family situation..." She let out a heavy sigh. "If you break off the engagement, where are you going to find a better future?"

If it had been literally anyone else running that script, I would've shut it down in two seconds flat. Told them l didn't need Rhys to survive. Told thiem my love ilfe was none of thelr damn business.

But Louise wes dlfferent.

She wasn't scheming. She wasn't playing me. She meant every word, and that made my throat jam up like rush hour trafflc.

'd always been the type to bite back when someone pushed. But if someone pulled, spoke soft,held my hand like I was made of glass? I melted into a bloody puddle.

So when she clutched my hand tighter and begged, "Please, for my sake, don't call off the wedding," all I could do was stand there, useless, swallowing everything I wanted to say.

Nhen Louisa drifted back to sleep, I finally peeled myself away and slipped out.

still felt guilty as hell, but not guilty enough to throw myself back into Rhys's arms like a lobotomized isney princess.

had barely made it five steps when Catherine ambushed me in the stairwell.

No audience now. No fake smiles. Just full-blown venom in her eyes.

She sneered, "You really are something. Using other people to force Rhys's hand."

tilted my head, sizing her up. It took me a second to piece it together. She thought I had used Louisa's health to screw with Rhys.

My eyes narrowed. "You think I made Aunt Louisa sick on purpose?"

Catherine snorted. "Isn't that exactly what you did? Or maybe you and Aunt Louisa cooked up some soap 4opera plot to force Rhys into marrying you."

I stared at her. "You actually believe Aunt Louisa faked a hospital trip just to marry me off to Rhys?"

Catherine didn't answer. She just smiled that smug little smile that made me want to smack the lip gloss off her face.

I sighed."lncase you forgot: I'm the one trying to cancel the bloody engagement. I'd be thrilled if Rhys slapped a ring on your finger tomorrow. Hell, I'll even buy the champagne."
###Chapter 32 Legally Binding


Of course she didn't belleve me.

Catherine crossed her arms. "All fust your tricks. You say you want out, but you're olinging to him every chance you get. Now that he's finally interested in me, you're pulling stunts to drag him back."

I wanted to throw up my arms like a cartoon character. It was like talking to a wall.

"Catherine," I said, gritting my teeth, "Rhys isn't refusing to end it because he's stifl obsessed with me. He's doing it because he's terrified of what the tabloids will say. He's doing it because he's too much of a coward to tell his mum no. The same goes for you. You're coming at me because you're too scared to pick a fight with Rhys or Louisa. You two really are a match made in dysfunctional heaven."

"It's not like that! Rhys is just worried about his mum's health. That's why he won't end things yet."

"Right. And you, standing here hissing at me to tell Louisa about your little love story with Rhys-means you're obviously not worried about her health at all, right? Or are you secretly hoping I piss her off so badly she ends up back in hospital-or, better yet, kicks the bucket-so I'll be too busy being the villain to hang onto Rhys, and you can swoop in without her giving you side-eye?"

"... no, it's not... I don't-"

I shook my head. "You really should take up chess. You've got the scheming down cold."

The flash of panic in her eyes was so fast most people would have missed it. I didn't.

I leaned in a little and got into her personal space. "If you've got that much energy, maybe aim it at Rhys instead of me. Whisper sweet nothings to him, play your cards right. Hell, if you can get him to ditch me officially, I'll owe you a drink. But even if he dumps me, don't get your hopes up. Rhys Granger might be a lot of things, but easy isn't one of them."

I didn't wait for her comeback. I just brushed past her and left.

Outside the hospital, I pulled my borrowed coat tighter against the morning chill and tried to flag a taxi.

A sleek black Cayenne rolled up to the curb.
Window down. Ashton's face appeared. "Get in. I'll drive you home."

For a second, I just blinked at him. I thought he'd left ages ago.

I shook my head. "It's fine. I'll grab a cab."

"It's too early. You won't get a cab here. I'm headed back to Oakwood Apartments anyway. Might as well give you a lift."

I hesitated a beat, then nodded."Thanks."

I slid into the front seat.

The bag in my lap felt ridiculously/ heavy. Inside were my heels and a blanket, reminders of what he'd done for me without me even asking.

Reminders of the fact that Ashton was being too nice. Way too nice.

Nicer than our little contract arrangement called for.

And I had no bloody clue why.

We drove in silence for a few minutes before he broke it."Mrs.Granger doing alright?"

I nodded, fighting off a yawn. "Yeah. The doctor says she can be discharged in a few days."

"So... Mrs. Granger still won't let you call off the engagement?"

My eyes snapped open. "You've been eavesdropping?"

"The door to her room was open. I was just passing by."

"For such a busy man, you sure spend a lot of time passing by places."

He shrugged. "You don't want to upset Mrs. Granger. What's your plan now?"

I flicked my eyes up and caught his face in the rear-view mirror. Sharp jaw, unreadable expression. He wasn't even looking at me, but somehow I still felt cornered.

Plan? The engagement was already off as far as I was concerned. Rhys just wouldn't let go, and Louisa was clinging to the fantasy.
It was my turn to shrug. "No Idea. I'm winging it."

"Don't you find It troublesome to have to keep dealing with this?"

I sighed."Yeah.it is."

We hit a red light. The silence stretched. Then he turned to look at me, full-on. "I've got a way to fix it."

"What kind of way?"

The light turned green.

He hit the accelerator and said, "Marry me. Like I said before."

Silence.Dead,awkward,what-the-hell silence.

He said it again, like he was offering me a lift and not flipping my life upside down."Marry me. It's your best option."

"Um..." was the best reply I could come up with.

When I'd roped Ashton into fake-fiancé duty, it was pure survival mode. I'd figured he was doing it to get his parents off his back-just like I was.

But now he looked deadly serious. Like he'd always meant to turn our make-believe into a legally binding situation.

"Why?"|finally managed. Because honestly, what else do you even say to that?

"Mrs. Granger doesn't actually care if you marry Rhys. What bothers her is the idea of you being alone, with no one dependable in your corner. She thinks your family's useless."

"She's not wrong,"I muttered.

He kept going, like he'd been rehearsing."If you had someone solid, someone she could trust to have your back, she'd let it go. The Rhys matchmaking, the passive-aggressive guilt trips, all of it. And if you married me...that would tick every box."

I stared at him. Anyone else saying 'marry me, I'm your best option' would've sounded like a narcissist with a God complex.

But Ashton just made it sound like he was stating facts.
"The Grangers seem the type to hold a grudge. Even if you manage to call off the engagement, no one in Skyline's going to want to piss them off by marrying you. No one but me. I don't care what the Grangers think. They wouldn't dare cross me. If I'm the one standing next to you, Mrs. Granger can finally give up."

He paused, then answered my unspoken objection as if he'd already anticipated it.

If she's not stupid, she'll know I'm ten times the man her son will ever be."
 ###Chapter 33 Not A Charade


Silence.

Annoyingly persuasive silence.

I hated how tempted I was.

Rhys Granger used to be the guy every woman in Skyline had on her dream board. Me included, back whenl didn't know he was a full-time bastard. Catherine, Serenna-hell, we were all drunk on the fantasy.

But now Ashton Laurent was the real obsession. Not just the last name-though, yeah, being a Laurent definitely opened doors-but the man himself. The brains, the backbone, the unnerving calm.

Marrying him would be the ultimate power move.

And unlike the other preening, entitled bachelors, he actually acted like a decent human being. Every time we'd crossed paths, he'd been polite,respectful.

Which made him even more dangerous.

Honestly, if I had to pick someone out of everyone I knew, he was the safest bet by a mile.

But that was the bit that didn't make sense.

We'd barely seen each other. A few run-ins, some short conversations, and, yes, one wild night together.

But nothing remotely close to "hey, let's-ruin our lives together" territory.

So why the hell was he offering to marry me like it was no big deal?

He could have anyone. Literally anyone. There were women in Skyline who'd trample their own sisters to get his number.

What did I have that made me wife materia in Ashton Laurent's billionaire brain?

I looked at him and straight up asked,"Why me?"

"It doesn't have to be a permanent situation. If things don't work out, we can split after a year."
I narrowed my eyes. "That's not what I asked.I said-why me?"

His mouth curled slightly. "Doesn't have to be you. You're right, l've got options, and I'm guessing you do too. But out of all the people we could have dragged into a pretend marriage, I'm still your best pick. That's why you came to me in the first place, yes?"

"Yes," I said reluctantly.

"Miss Vance, I'm not playing house. This wouldn't be some cutesy charade. It'd be a real, legal marriage.With paperwork. With rings. You'd have a marriage certificate and a title that means something. And with that, you can tell Mrs. Granger to back off, and your family to shove their matchmaking plans. You'd finally have the upper hand."

He paused just long enough to make it clear he wasn't bluffing. "Think about it."

***


I had no clue how I made it back to Oakwood Apartments.

At some point, Ashton had dropped me at my doorstep, then headed back to the office like he didn't need sleep.

I unlocked my door, stumbled to the sofa, and flopped down.

His words wouldn't stop replaying.

"Marry me."

"I'm your best option."

I lay there, staring into nothing, trying to digest the world's weirdest proposal.

Marriage.Real marriage. Not the fake kind. This was legit, legal, and terrifying.

Even if we were just putting on a show for our families, it'd still be a show with contracts and paperwork and probably a joint tax return.

He needed a buffer from his family. I needed to shut down Louisa and her delusions. Fine. Strategic partnership, one-year term, no sex, no drama. Easy,right?

I told myself it was fine. Totally fine. Very normal to consider marrying a man I barely knew just to get my life back.

It didn't help that my brain had turned into a courtroom. One tiny lawyer-me was screaming "Run!"; the other one was already drawing up the prenup.

They bickered so loudly in my head I thought I might throw something.

I lay sprawled like a zombie for a bit, then gave up trying to think and stumbled into the shower.

Two minutes later I was face-planted in bed, lights still on, hair still damp, consciousness entirely gone.

By the time I got to Nyx Collective the next morning, I looked semi-human.Barely.

A whole flock of interns had formed a human shrine around Violet Lin, who was basking in the attention and waving her hands around.

"The Laurent party was insane. I swear, the road was lined with luxury cars. Only the crème de la crème of Skyline City even got through the gates... Obviously, I was on the guest list. Oh, and I talked to the heir,you know, the one who just got back from overseas? He's hotter than any actor. I mean, movie-star jawline, a killer bod. You get it."

I didn't get it. Or care.

I swerved around the Violet fan club and headed straight for my desk.

The second she spotted me, her whole vibe shifted. Her smile twitched. She continued her story but kept glancing over at me like I might jump up and shout "You lie!" any moment.

When I didn't say anything, she relaxed. Her shoulders dropped, her voice got louder, and the fake stories flowed like boxed wine at an office party.

I tried sketching.Five design drafts, all garbage. I gave up after I realized draft six looked suspiciously like Ashton's face and headed for the break room, hunting for caffeine.

But his voice followed me there like a persistent ghost.

"Marry me."

"I'm your best option."

I blinked and realized the water dispenser was overflowing. I fumbled to turn it off before the flood reached my shoes.

"What's got you so spaced out?"

I jumped, nearly launching the bloody cup across the room.

Violet was leaning against the door jamb.

She clicked her tongue. "Seriously? It was an innocent question. You look like you just got caught burying a body. You up to something shady?"

I didn't answer. Just grabbed some napkins, wiped down the counter, and headed for the door.

"Stop!" Violet blocked my path. "Didn't you hear me talking to you?"

"There's nothing to talk about." I didn't even slow down.

Our mutual fake-nice era was very much over, and I wasn't interested in reruns.

But she stepped in front of me again and hissed in a low voice,"You'd better keep what happened at the Laurent party to yourself. Don't go running your mouth to the others,got it?" 
###Chapter 34 Corporate Robot


I looked at her. "You do realize I wasn't the only one at that party? Even If I say nothing, other people talk."

"Except you and me, no one else from Nyx was at that party. They don't run in that crowd. If you keep quiet,no one here needs to know a thing."

"Relax. I've got better things to do than rehash your embarrassing five minutes of fame."

I made another attempt to leave, but Violet clearly wasn't done with her one-woman paranoia parade.

"As long as you don't tell anyone I nicked the prototype, I won't show anyone that little video of you going full WWE at the party.Fair?"

Oh. So we were doing blackmail now. Fun.

I stared her down. "You think I care if they find out | threw a punch?"

Yes, some people at Nyx liked me. Yes, I had work friends.

But they weren't ride-or-die, more like Monday-to-Friday lunch pals.

"Go ahead and tell whoever you want. I'm not the one who stole from the company."

Violet's mouth twisted. "Of course you care. You looked like a lunatic, and I've got it on video. You were way more embarrassing than | was."

"So what's the plan,Violet?"

"There is no plan. Just keep your mouth shut, and I'll keep mine."

"I'm hardly one for break-room gossip, and frankly, you're not interesting enough for me to spread rumors about."

She relaxed a little."Good."

"But..."

"But what?"
"But you stealing that necklace from the showroom is not just gossip fodder. If's career suicide.If Savannah finds out, you won't just be unemployed, you'll be blacklisted from the entire industry."

Her whole face twitched. "I put it back! No one at Nyx knows, and they won't-unless you telf them!"

I raised a brow. "You do know Savannah has access to the surveillance tapes, right? And that she reviews them periodically? If she spots you on her own, that's on you, not me."

The color drained from her face so fast I thought she might faint. I could practically see the calculations behind her eyes-trying to figure out how to wipe the footage before Savannah got curious.

A few minutes later, Savannah's assistant popped her head in and asked me to head to her office.

Violet got summoned too. She walked in like she was heading to her own execution, all pale lips and shaky breath, clearly convinced I'd already tattled.

But Savannah didn't mention the necklace. Not even a side-eye. Instead, she launched into business.

"Eliza Black's been getting dragged online for weeks. Looks like it only made her dig her heels in, because she wants a full custom set from Nyx Collective, something unique to wear at the Cannes Film Festival next month. If she stuns, we ride the wave and launch the new luxe line off the back of it."

Savannah paused long enough for the weight of it to settle.

"Anyone who wants to can submit designs. Whoever she picks leads the project," she said. "It's our shot.Don't mess it up."

Violet was bouncing. "I'll make sure she loves my work!"

Of course she would. She'd been quietly stewing ever since I beat her out for the last commission.

If Eliza showed up to Cannes dripping in one of Violet's designs, she'd be waving her victory banner all over the Nyx group chat.

I gave a more measured nod. "I'll be ready."

The second I stepped out of Savannah's office, my phone buzzed.

l ignored Violet's taunting looks and checked the message:

"Your dry cleaning is ready for pick-up."
Right. Almost forgot.

I'd worn Ashton's jacket home yesterday after he lent it to me at the hospital.

I was going to hand-wash it at first, but one touch and I chickened out.

That thing felt more expensive than my entire wardrobe.

Definitely custom.

Definitely something that would disintegrate if I got anywhere near it with soap.

So I took it to the fancy dry cleaner on 5th instead.

After work, I headed straight there to pick it up.

On the wvay back, I passed the bakery near the corner and grabbed a few cupcakes.

Figured I might as well soften the awkwardness of returning a man's jacket with sugar.

I got to Oakwood Apartments and stood in front of Ashton's door.

My heart was doing its own little cardio class.

I knocked.

Waited.

Knocked again.

Nothing.

Of course he wasn't home.

He probably only slept two hours a day and worked hundred-hour weeks.

Still, I stood there for a beat longer than I meant to, oddly disappointed.

Back in my flat, I messaged him: When will you be back at Oakwood? I've got your jacket.

I stared at the screen for two minutes.

No reply.
I ate dinner.

Watched an entire episode of The Infernal Housewives of Skyline City.

Still nothing.

Not even a blue tick.

Maybe he didn't give a damn about the jacket.

Maybe once someone else touched it, it wwas dead to him.

Like one of those people who won't rewear socks if someone else has washed them.

It was nearly ten.

I'd showered, blow-dried my hair, slathered on night cream, and was just about to go to bed when my phone finally buzzed.

Ashton: I won't be back at Oakwood any time soon. Bring it to Laurent Global Holdings headquarters tomorrow.

No "please." No "thanks."

Just a straight-up instruction, like I was one of his interns.

I typed back: Got it.

Didn't add a smiley.

He didn't deserve one.

His message had the warmth of a parking ticket.

Maybe this was the real Ashton Laurent-zero charm, full corporate robot.

I was about to put my phone away when it rang.

Unknown number.

Could've been a scam call.

More likely Rhys Granger again.
I hung up instantly and blocked the number.

Next morning, I took half a day off just to drop the damn jacket off at Laurent Global Holdings.
 ###Chapter 35 Not A Date


The building sat like a smug, glass monolith right in the middle of downtown, prime real estate with a reflective metal fa?ade that flashed sunlight in every direction, as if it were trying to blind the poor.

Slxty-eight floors of money.

It towered over everything, like ft knew it owned the skyline.

LGH didn't just deal in real estate and finance.

They had their fingers in every pie-tech, hospitality, tourism, you name it.

If it generated income, they were knee-deep in it.

The place was also a hotspot for influencers and wannabe TikTok stars.

I'd passed it plenty of times and seen people doing twirls or filming dance routines right outside the entrance.

I'd never actually gone in.

Inside, it was all clean lines, matte finishes, and subtle displays of wealth.

Like, "Yes, this chair costs more than your car, but we won't mention it."

You couldn't get past the lobby without clearance.

Which meant I was promptly intercepted by the front desk, where a girl with perfect eyeliner looked me up and down like I'd shown up to a Met Gala in Crocs.

"You can't go upstairs without an appointment," she said, smiling the way dentists do before drilling into a nerve. "Mr. Laurent gets swamped with requests every day. His calendar's booked out months in advance."

She gave me another once-over.

I could tell exactly what she was thinking-here's another one, trying to land a billionaire with a fresh blowout and a hopeful bra.
Joke's on her. I hadn? even bothered with mascara.

"Maybe come back in thee months,"she suggested, this time with á sprinklé of pity

I didn't argue.

There was no point.

I found a seat in the lobby's vlsitor zone and texted him: I'm at LGH. Can I leave the jacket at reception?

Ten minutes ticked by.

Then five more.

By the time the reply came, I was seconds away from hurling the jacket at the nearest bin and calling it a day.

Ashton:Contact Dominic Everett, my assistant.

He sent a phone number.

No explanation.

No "thanks."

I stared at the message, already annoyed.

All this hassle for one stupid jacket.

First, I had to take time off.

Then I got treated like a groupie or wannabe gold-digger.

Now I had to track down his assistant like Iwas hand-delivering the Ark of the Covenant?

God, I was such a mug.

All this effort for a guy who texted like a contract clause.

Still, I'd already come this far.

Might as well see it through and avoid the karmic curse of unfinished favors.

A个箱mst gomeone here had manders.

Ihanded it over, then asked, mostly to make corlversaltion, "s yout boss H a meeting?"

Dommic blinked. "Mr. Leurent dlidn't oome in today. No meeting's. Hu's... on a dute."

"A date?" The word just sllpped out. "With who?"

Dominic glanced around.

He looked like a kid sitting on a Christmas secret.

Clearly dying to spill, but also shackled by his corporate leash.

I just stared at him.

Waited.

Eventually, the leash snapped.

"Octavia Grey," he whispered, like it was classified intel. "She's been after our boss for ages."

I blinked.

Octavia Grey.

The hottest A-lister on the planet right now.

She just won the biggest film award in the country for some critically acclaimed indie drama.

You couldn't open your phone without her face popping up-red carpets, interviews, aesthetic brunch pics.

She had that lethal combo of fame, talent, and bone structure.

But I'd seen her in clips-she was the definition of icy-hot.
Always looked like she'd sooner roll her eyes than flirt.

And now she was chasing Ashton Laurent?

While I was trying to process the mental image of those two breathing the same air, Dominic dropped another bomb.

"Miss Vance, I'm sure you know, um, our boss is in a rush to get married."

I didn't know whether to laugh or wince.

The fact that even Ashton's assistant openly discussed his desperation to tie the knot made my brain glitch.

I said,"Yeah,I know."

Ashton had said he wanted me to think about his little marriage proposal.

But from the looks of things, I wasn't the only one with a spot on the shortlist.

If I said no, maybe he'd be signing marriage papers with Octavia Grey by tomorrow.

The man wasn't kidding about being in a rush.

It was a business deal for him, obviously.

He probably thought any warm body would do.

But was it the same for me?

If I said no to him, would I also have options?

Technically,yes.

There was Rhys, with Louisa's blessing, and Leonard Something my mother tried to set me up with.

Last night, I blocked Rhys.

It felt amazing for about seven hours.

Then this morning, he called me from two different numbers, like a desperate Tinder ghost who couldn't take a hint.

And my mother had been blowing up my phone too.
I didn't even need to pick up to know what she'd say.

Looking at it now, marriage with Ashton might actually be the smartest move I could make, and possibly the only move, short of moving away and changing my name.

Dominic spoke again.

"Please excuse my being so direct, but l've worked with Mr. Laurent for years and, trust me, he's not into those celebrity types. You're the one he's most satisfied with, Miss Vance. You should really consider your position."

"Right." I nodded. "I'll think about it."
###Chapter 36 Ashton's POV: Pressure Game


Dominic waited until Mirabelle Vance disappeared down the street before heading back in, the laundry bag dangling from his arm.

At the front desk, one of the reception girls stopped him.

"Dom, who was that just now?"

She was trying to play it casual, but he could see the regret all over her face.

She'd clearly thought Mirabelle was a nobody earlier and now wanted a do-over.

"She didn't give her name. Is she really here to see the big boss? How come she doesn't have an appointment? I thought-"

"Stop asking so many questions," Dominic said, barely slowing down. "Next time she shows up, don't make her wait. Let her through straightaway. Got it?"

The girl swallowed. "Y-yeah. Got it."

Dominic hit the lift and rode up to thesixty-eighth floor, where the C-suite had their offices.

His boss was standing by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his back to him.

Dominic wasn't sure if he was watching the skyline or tracking Mirabelle's movement.

He placed the laundry bag on a nearby coffee table.

"Boss. I said everything you told me to. Dropped enough pressure on her to make her nervous. She's definitely thinking now."

Ashton didn't turn around.

"Good."

His voice was calm, but his eyes had that look again-sharp, locked in, like he was already planning how to corner her next.
His personal phone lit up.

Dominic checked the caller ID. "Boss, it's your father."

Ashton turned around, took the phone, and answered,"What."

"That's exactly what I want to ask," Reginald snapped. "You walked out of your own damn party. The one meant to introduce you to every major player in Skyline. Half the city's still buzzing about it. Do you realize the media's gone feral?"

"Not my problem." Ashton leaned back against the glass, fingers drumming on the window ledge.

"You're LGH's CEO. Every damn twitch you make rattles our stock. I happen to own some of it, you know.This affects me,too."

"Then maybe diversify."

Reginald ignored that. "They're saying you collapsed. Or that LGH is sinking and you've fled the wheel.I haven't slept since. Been running PR interference, trying to slap a gag order on some of the more outrageous stories floating out there. You know, you could've given me a heads-up before pulling a vanishing act."

"I don't owe anyone an explanation. Least of all the jackals circling for a quote. The people who mattered got a call."

"Some of those 'jackals' are long-time partners. Investors. Businessmen who flew in from three time zones away to shake your hand. They were left with hors d'oeuvres and no heir in sight. Do you think that's good for business?"

"They'll live. And if they want to keep doing business with LGH, they'll get over it. Let's not pretend the economy's doing great. We're the last ship worth boarding. They need us more than we need them."

Silence fell.

Then Reginald tried a new angle. "Fine, You handle the business. But what about the girl?"

Ashton's jaw ticked. "What about her."

"The one you said we'd meet but didn't. What am I supposed to say to your grandfather? He's convinced he's got one foot in the grave. He wants awedding. A great-grandkid. Gwen and I were supposed to meet the girl,and-"

"Il talk to him."

That shut Reginald up for a beat.

Then he conceded, "Alright. I'll leave that to you,too."

"Good."

"Wait, don't hang up yet!" Reginald's voice changed, awkward and slippery. "There's... an opportunity.Some new fund. Hedge-adjacent. I'd need some liquidity to get in early-"

"No."

"Just hear me out-"

"No." Ashton didn't even blink. "You said that with the golf resort in North Korea. It tanked."

"This one's different."

"You said that too, about the cryotherapy chain. Which, last I checked, froze your assets into near bankruptcy."

"It's not the same."

"Neither was the NFT art gallery. Remember that? The one that 'just needed influencer traction' and ended up being a PowerPoint scam with a domain hosted on GoDaddy."①

"Alright, alright. I got your point. But I'm your father and I could use-"

"I might consider helping you," Ashton said coolly, "if you keep your wife from treating me like the finalrose on The Bachelor. I don't need another list of 'eligible' daughters from the Manhattan Yacht Club. Or a random heiress texting me at 3 a.m. because Gwendolyn has given out my number without my permission,again."

Reginald sighed. "She's just trying to help. You're.almost thirty-one and still single. She wants to see you settled."

"I'll settle when I want. What I need now is for her to stop bleeding money on events no one remembers and clothes she'll never wear. You rein her in, maybe I write a cheque. No promises."
"Fine.I'H talk to her."

Ashton ended the call.

Dominic stepped in, arms full.

"Boss. These are flowers from Miss Grey. Concert tickets from a-uh-Miss Kendra Lucille? Gift baskets from... Miss Yvette Summers, Miss Liliana Hart, and Miss Noemi Bancroft. Oh, and this..." He set down a long velvet case. "An antique flintlock from Miss Desiree Lang. Guess she heard about your little shooting club phase in Switzerland."

Ashton didn't even glance at the pile."Chuck the flowers. Tickets go to whichever secretary fixes the office printer. Gift baskets-food goes to the staff. Whatever can't be eaten, sell it online. Donate the money to a children's charity."

Dominic grinned. "On it, boss. Can I keep one of the concert tckets? I happen to like the band."

"Sure."

"Thanks, boss." Dominic turned to leave, then paused."Oh. The safe you ordered has arrived. Installed five minutes ago."

"Good." Ashton opened the drawer behind him and pulled out a small velvet box.

He flicked it open with one hand.

Inside sat a necklace. Clean lines, high-contrast design, platinum sharp as a whisper.

If Mirabelle were here, she'd have recognized it instantly.

Veyra.

Her design.

The one she'd made for Eliza Black.

The one that had gone viral and drawn all kinds of mixed reviews.

He snapped the box shut and handed it to Dominic.

"Lock this in the safe. Later. Personally."
Dominic took it. "Yes, boss."
###Chapter 37 Win-win


I'd been stewing over it all day and stlll hadn't decided.

Marriage wasn't Hke picking a flavor of ice cream.

You couldn't just go,"oops, not that one," and hit undo.

# Ashton were just Ashton, some guy with a decent job and a halfway-decent sense of humor, I might've jumped in headfirst.

But he wasn't.

He was Ashton bloody Laurent.

As in Laurent Global Holdings, Laurent Towers, Laurent being-on-the-news-for-buying-a-small-country kind of Laurent.

While I was busy spiraling in my flat, Yvaine texted me in all caps: GET YOUR ASS OUT. WE'RE DRINKINVG.NO EXCUSES.

She didn't need to shout,but whatever.

could use a distraction.

And maybe a bit of tequila would kill my indecisive streak.

Ithrew on a loose red jumper and skinny jeans, then headed out.

Skyline had dipped to near-zero this week, but the bar was sweaty as hell.

Loud music, overpriced drinks, and enough perfume in the air to set off a fire alarm.

Yvaine slung her arm around my shoulders and leaned in, shouting over the bass, "Just the two of us is boring. Let's order a few male hosts!"

I rolled my eyes. "Order some for yourself, babe. I'm good."

She narrowed her eyes. "Wait. You're in a mood. What happened?"
I took a sip-whlskey sour, not bad-and muttered, "There's something I need to decide. I can't telf ff doing f would be insane or just... Impulsive."

"Please don't tell me this is about Rhys again. If he shows up trying to 'fálk things out,' I swear fo God, Mira,you must not cave, or I'll dlsown you on the spot."

"It's not about Rhys," I said, then paused. "Actually, random question-aren't you kind of tight with that friend of Ashton's? Cas or whatever?"

Cassian Langford?" Her nose wrinkled.mates with my brother Emmett. Always hanging around the ouse like a stray. What about him?"

He's friends with Ashton, right? Think you could casually fish around for me? Get some intel on Ashton?"

er eyes went wide. "Why the hell are you digging into Ashton? Don't you already know him, being fake-ngaged to him and all? Why ask someone else about him? What exactly do you want to know?"

His dating history, maybe."

Come again?" She blinked like I'd glitched. "Why do you care about that? Wait-don't tell me you've actually aught feelings? Wasn't this whole engagement thing just pretend?"

Focus, gossip later. Just find out what you can."

Fine, fine." She sighed. "I think I heard Cas say something the other day. Lemme call him."

She disappeared into the loo with her phone and reappeared barely three minutes later.

Got the goods. Cassian says Ashton's been hung up on some girl for years. Problem is, she's got a poyfriend. He never had a shot, but appårently he's still not over her. Hasn't dated anyone else since."

stared at my drink, my fingers tightening around the glass.

So that was the ghost in his closet.

Yvaine went on. "But that was ages ago. Ashton went off to Europe, and Cas doesn't exactly have eyes on his love life over there. So whatever intel he's got could be totally outdated."

"Or he's still not over her," I said, half to myself.

Yvaine gave me a long look. Then-bam-realization hit.
Her face morphed into a cocktail of pity, sympathy, and fulf-body cringe.

"Wait. Oh no. Honey, you've actually fallen for him? Are you serious? 「mean, yeah, he's hot. And richer than every ancestor l've got going back to the Bronze Age. But ff he's stilf hung up on someone else and you go chasing him... isn't that just you and Rhys all over again?"

"Exactly," I said.

And that was the point.

#f Ashton was still pining for some long-lost ex, that just confirmed one thing-he wasn't expecting anything from me.

Then this marriage was exactly what he said it was.

A cold, clean, no-strings deal.

"If that's the case," I muttered, "marrying him doesn't sound too bad..."

Yvaine shrieked. "What marriage? Who the hell are you marrying?"

She didn't even wait for me to answer. "Please tell me it's not Rotten Rhys. Mira, babe, I swear, if you're even thinking about going back to that sentient trash fire-"

"It's not him," I cut in. "It's Ashton."

Her jaw hit the floor.

She stared at me in mute horror for a full two minutes.

Just blinking. Processing,

Probably trying to remember if I'd hit my head recently.

Then finally: "You drunk? Did you eat something weird? Did Rhys spike your drink with stupid pills? You're marrying Ashton Laurent? Like, for real real?"

I nodded. "Thinking about it."

Yvaine reached out and felt my forehead like she was checking for a fever.

"Darling, are you okay? Do we need to call someone? The Grangers have clearly scrambled your brain.You think you can fust marry a Laurent like ordering a cake?"

1 grabbed her wrist and gently lowered her hand.

"Let me explain,"1 såld, then walked her through the whole quickie mnárrlage proposál situation.

The more I talked, the wider her mouth got.

By the time I was done, she looked like someone could've shoved a tennis balf in there and she wouldn't even notice.

I reached over and gently shut her jaw for her.

"That's the deal. He came to me, not the other way round. I'm still thinking it through."

Yvaine rebooted after about a minute of blank staring, then shot off the bar stool like her arse had caught fire and grabbed both my hands in a death grip.

"What's there to think through? Mira, don't think, just do! Marry him tomorrow! He's, like, a million times better than Rotten Rhys. There is literally no man in Skyline more gorgeous and loaded than Ashton fucking Laurent!"

I pulled her back down onto the stool.

"Okay, calmn the hell down. Marriage is still kind of a big deal, don't you think? This feels... too fast."

"Fast is the new normal," she fired back. "Half the city's out here getting hitched after three Tinder swipes.Say yes first, panic later. Worst case, you divorce. Best case, you get to stare at that face every morning over coffee.Win-win."

Then she smirked, her whole expression going full perv. "And let's be real, you marry him,things are bound to liven up in the bedroom. I mean, you've got first-hand experience, haven't you? He probably fuc-"

I smacked the back of her head. "Jesus, get your brain out of the gutter!"

Yvaine dropped the act, her voice growing serious.

"Look, all jokes aside, Ashton's solid, at least from what l've known about him so far. Plus, can you imagine Rhys's face when he finds out you married a Laurent? He'll have a fucking meltdown. I'll throw a party just to rub it in."
By the time we'd dissected every angle, drawn diagrams, and ránked Ashton's abs on a ten-point scale (he scored twelve), I'd elready made up my mind.

After work the next day, I was lying on my sofa like a corpse, clutching my phone.

I'd written and rewritten the damn message so many times, my thumbs were sore.

Every time I hovered over Send, I chickened out and hit backspace.

By the time the clock hit eight, I'd typed a whole novella and deleted all of it.

And then the lights cut out.

Dead. Black. Silent.

I just lay there blinking like, seriously?

My old apartment went dark every time someone sneezed too hard.

Now this one was on the same bullshit?

I shot upright and jabbed the property management number.

No answer.

Tried again.

Still nothing.

Third time-voicemail.

"Brilliant," I muttered, already half-pissed.

Wasri't Oakwood Apartments supposed to be under Laurent Global Holdings?

Ashton Laurent owned the place.

He even had a flat here, so unless he liked showering in the dark, he should've sorted this crap out ages ago.

I shoved on some fluffy slippers and padded out into the hallway.
###Chapter 38 Ashton's POV: Close the Deal


When Mirabelle knocked, Ashton was rinsing grime off his hands.

He had just been down in the stairwell, flipping the main breaker.

Manufactured blackout.

It wasn't an original move, but it was effective.

Three days.

He had given her three whole days to respond.

She hadn't.

He was already losing his mind.

He had spent the entire day in the office glued to his phone.

Every notification made his pulse spike, but none of the messages were from her.

Cassian had asked him out for drinks that evening, but he shut it down.

He was too restless, too wired.

Having wrapped his work early, he drove straight to Oakwood Apartments.

He knew she was in her flat, but if she wouldn't come to him, then...

He cut the power.

A minute later, he was in the stairwell, fiddling with the fuse box while she held up her phone as a torch.

A few seconds later, the lights snapped back on.

"Thanks!" Mirabelle sounded relieved. "I'Il go check if everything's okay."

"Just a minute." Ashton turned. "Miss Vance, have you made up your mind?"

She blinked.
The hallway lights illuminated the hesitation on her face as he closed the distance.

She stepped back instinctively.

He still towered over her, close enough to notice the way her lashes fluttered.

The way she chewed her bottom lip as if it might help her decide.

Christ. That mouth.

He remembered exactly how it tasted, that night in the hotel room.

He remembered how it had moaned through clenched teeth, how it had gone slack when she came.

It hadn't said his name, though.

That was the one imperfection in an otherwise flawless night.

She hadn't known who he was then.

She would now.

Ashton clenched his jaw and forced the thought away.

Getting hard in a goddamn hallway wasn't the plan.

Neither was terrifying her into running.

She already looked like she might bolt if he so much as breathed too loudly.

So he stayed still.

Pretending he hadn't memorized every expression she made in bed.

Pretending he wasn't picturing her up against the door, saying his name like a prayer.

"l-I'm still thinking..." she muttered.

Ashton tilted his head down, his voice inches from her crown. "I'm done waiting. Give me a yes tonight."

Mirabelle looked up so fast she nearly broke his jaw.

"It's just a contract, Miss Vance. A mutually beneficial one." He let the words hang for a beat, then added,
"There's no conjugal duty."

Not unless you want it.

That part he kept to himself-along with the very vivid image of her flat on his bed, breathless, begging,screaming his name until her throat gave out.

He'd bet his entire portfolio she sounded just as perfect wrecked as she dlid sarcástic.

Out loud, he was cool, clinical.

"We'll need to keep up appearances in public. Galas, fundraisers, the occasional magazine cover. You'd have to play the part-my wife. I get that's a burden. Might eat into your personal time...maybe even your dating life."

His jaw flexed at that.

Imagining her on someone else's arm made something dark rise in his throat, but he shoved it down.

"So here's my offer," he said. "At the end of one year, you get ten million. Compensation for your time,your social life, your... inconvenience. If it works, we extend. For the second year, fifteen million. Third year,twenty.Escalating terms. Entirely optional. No strings if you walk after the first."

He leaned back slightly, giving her space he didn't want to give.

His voice stayed measured.

His pulse didn't.

"Ten... million?" Her voice cracked."As in dollars?"

He cocked a brow. "Too low? I can bump it up to-"

"Nope! No! That's...fine! Totally fine!" She was waving her hands like she was trying to flag down a plane.

"So this works for you?" he pressed.

A pause.

Then, very softly, "It works."

He released a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding.
"Good. Then we're registering the marriage tomorrow."

"Wh-what? Tomorrow?!" she gasped, her voice shooting up an octave."Don't you think that's a bit fast?"

"My grandfather is dying. He wants to see me settled before he..." Ashton layered in just enough grief to make it sound real, though he didn't feel a damn thing.

"Oh."

Then he tacked on, deadpan, "Hope you understand, Miss Vance. Bit of a time crunch."

"R-right...yeah. Totally get it."

"Great. We're registering the marriage tomorrow."

Mirabelle blinked. "Um...I guess, yeah, let's do it. But aren't there preparations to make?"

"I've already submitted my application. I can upload yours in under two minutes. You just need your ID."

He patted his pocket.

The $35 cash for the marriage license had been there since the first time he met her back in Skyline City-just in case the credit card system glitched the day he dragged her to the City Clerk's Office.

"But isn't there a waiting period?" she.asked.

"I'll get a judicial waiver."

"And a witness?"

"I'lI bring one."

Or twelve.

He wasn't taking chances.

Mirabelle looked at him, a bit dazed. "You've really thought of everything."

"|have."

"Then...I guess I'll see you tomorrow morning?"

"I'll pick you up at eight."
The City Clerk's Office opened at 8:30, but traffic was unpredictable, and there might be couples ahead of them.

He made a mental note to call Dominic and have them bumped to the top of the list.

"Right. Then...good night," she said, still looking like she'd been hit by a very polite, very expensive bus.

But Ashton wasn't done. "That's the legal bit. Now, about the wedding-"

She spun. "Wait. There's a wedding? Like, reception and all?"

"Isn't that tradition? I was thinking reception at The Plaza right after the City Clerk's, then-"

"Whoa. Slow down." She raised a hand like she was directing traffic. "That's way too soon. Weddings take months to plan."

"I see. You don't want to rush it. So, postpone the reception a few months? That way you can send out invites, arrange flowers-"

"NO,"she cut in. "I mean maybe...no reception. At all. This is mostly for your grandfather, right? The certificate should be enough. And this ends in a year. No point splurging on a big wedding."

"Oh." He masked his disappointment. "No reception,then."

"Right."

They said goodnight.

He kissed her. Featherlight. Restrained.

Which was a goddamn miracle, considering he wanted to slam her against the door and kiss her until she forgot her own name.

After she shut the door, he checked the time.

Still a few things to set in motion if he wanted tomorrow to run like clockwork.

There was only a registration. No wedding.

Fine. It was a minor setback.

But she'd change her mind. Sooner or later.
He'd make sure of ft.
###Chapter 39 Detour
When I opened the door to grab the mail, Ashton was already standing there with a coffee tray and a paper bag.

I blinked. "Uh, morning."

It came out awkward.


Couldn't help it.

Last night, I'd somehow agreed to marry the man,and my brain was still buffering.

"Morning," he said smoothly. "I brought breakfast."

Of course he had.

"Thanks. Come in. You look... nice."

Understatement of the damn year.

He was wearing a three-piece charcoal grey suit.

Not the stiff Wall Street kind, but something sharp and clearly custom-made.

The lapels were narrow, the trousers tailored within an inch of their life, and the stitching at the cuffs was subtle hand-embroidered initials-AL.

Jesus. Even his tie looked smug.

People complimented well-dressed men by saying they looked like a million bucks.
For Ashton, I'd have to add three more zeros, and that still felt like lowballing it.

We ate in the living room, though neither of us ate much.


My croissant sat there flaking quietly while my brain looped through the phrase "I'm getting married today"like a bad ringtone.

After about fifteen minutes of poking at the pastries,I glanced at the clock.

Still early

The City Clerk's Office wouldn't open for another hour and a half.


"Would you mind making a detour first?" I asked,not quite meeting his eyes.

"Not at all," he said instantly.s long as we're not late."


He drove.


In silence, mostly, because there were only so many ways to fill the air between "Want to get married?"and "Sure."


He pulled up outside the Vance residence.

I unbuckled. "Thanks. I won't be long."

"Do you want me to come with you?"

I hesitated, then shook my head. "No. I can handle it."

I grabbed the door handle, then paused.

Fine. He deserved context.
"I've been thinking about what you said. About Aunt Louisa. You were right-I shouldn't let guilt steer my decisions just because she's been... decent to me."l sighed. "Marriage should be about me and the person I'm actually marrying. Not how charming his mum might be."

He didn't say anything.

Just gave me a slight nod.

"I gave Rhys the ring back ages ago. But there's something else I forgot to return to theGrangers."

There had been an exchange of gifts when our families arranged the engagement.

My dad gave the Grangers an heirloom gold ring.

Louisa had it now.


The Grangers' gift had been a vintage brooch.

According to family lore, it once belonged to Louisa's great-great-great-grandmother, who probably wore it while judging people in oil paintings.

My parents had kept it locked away in a safe somewhere.


When I stepped inside the house, only Caroline was there.


She was on the sofa, sipping coffee.

"Well, well. Look whno finally showed her face," she sneered, without looking away from her mug. "You sounded real tough on the phone the other day. And now you've come crawling back? After slapping Catherine and Serenna in front of half the city? Unless you're here to apologize, save your breath."

"I've got nothing to apologize for. If anything Catherine should be apologizing for sleeping with my fiancé, and Serenna for trying to steal hers."

Her coffee cup hit the table so hard I thought the glass would crack.

"Unbelievable! I raised you. I fed you, clothed you,paid for your bloody orthodontist. And now you think you can just cut us off?"

Here we go. Again.

"Don't start with the Greatest Hits," I cut her off fast."I didn't come here for a lecture. I came for the brooch the Grangers gave us."

She frowned like I'd asked for her kidneys.

It took her a full five seconds to even remember what I was talking about.

Then her eyes narrowed.

"Why do you want that brooch?"

"I don't see how that's your business. It was given to me. It belongs to me." My patience was already on a three-second fuse.

"Absolutely not," she snapped, all tight-jawed fury."You're planning to return it, aren't you? To the Grangers?"

"So what if I am? Louisa gave it to me. I can do with it whatever I like."
 I checked my watch.

I'd stupidly thought this would be quick.

In, out, done. Five minutes, max.

But no,Caroline was digging her heels in.

"I'm your mother. I have every right to hold on to it for safekeeping."

"Exactly, safekeeping. As in, you're just the storage unit. And newsflash, when something's mine, I can take it back whenever the hell I want. Like...now."


"Absolutely not. It's way too valuable to just hand over."


I narrowed my eyes. "Are you giving it to me or not?"

She sniffed,mouth curling into that nasty little smirk she probably practiced in the mirror. "Even if I did give it away, it wouldn't be to you. If Rhys gets engaged to Catherine, she should have it."

"Then wait till they're engaged. Until then, it's still mine."


If I didn't hand that brooch back to Louisa myself,she'd keep thinking there was still something between me and Rhys.Which...ew.

"Still no." Caroline's eyes darted.

She knew damn well if Louisa had the final say, she'd never let that heirloom piece land on Catherine's backstabbing chest.

I raised a brow. "Oh, I see. You're scared Louisa and the Grangers won't accept Catherine, right? Scared that even if Rhys does propose, Louisa's going to pretend she doesn't see her? So you're just going to hoard the brooch like some paranoid dragon and hope no one notices? That's delusional, even for you."

That hit a nerve.

Her nostrils flared so wide I thought she might actually combust.

"How I handle things is my business," she hissed. "And mind your bloody tone. I'm your mother, not someone you get to lecture."

"Cool. Then you'll love this."

I whipped out my phone and started dialing.
###Chapter 40 Married


"Hi, yeah, I'd like to report stolen property. A vintage brooch, pearls and diamonds, easily worth seven figures. If someone refuses to return it, does that count as grand larceny? What kind of sentence are we talking-ten years minimum?"

"What the hell are you doing?!" Caroline shrieked, full banshee mode. "Have you lost your mind? Put that phone down!"

She lunged from the sofa.

One slipper flew off mid-sprint, but she didn't even notice.

Too busy flailing at me, trying to snatch the phone from my hand.

I stepped back calmly, dodging her grab like we were doing slow-mo tai chi.

"Too late.I already called the cops. They said they're on their way."

Caroline froze.

Her legs went wobbly, like someone had pulled the plug on her spine.

"You called the police? Over this little thing? Are you insane?"

"Oh,now it's just'alittle thing'?"I folded my arms. "If it's so unimportant, why have you spent the last ten minutes playing keep-away?"

"You don't call the police on your mother!" she shrieked. "What the hell is wrong with you? Do you even see me as family?"

"You've got two minutes to bring down the brooch. If you do, I'll cancel the police report. If not, I'tl tell them you stole the brooch from me and that it's worth millions. Let's see how that goes over."

She stared at me like I'd slapped her with a frying pan.

Then her mouth twisted into something sour and bitter.

"Fine.You win."
She spun around and stomped upstairs, muttering God knows what under her breath.

Probably hexes.

Truth was, I never made the call.

I just wanted to scare the hell out of her.

If she'd paid any attention, she'd have noticed I didn't give the 'police' my address.

It was just some light psychological warfare.

And it worked.

Still, I wasn't exactly doing a happy dance.

All I wanted was my own damn thing back, and she acted like I'd demanded a kidney.

This family had stopped seeing me as one of them a long time ago.

The sound of heels clattering down the staircase snapped me out of it.

Caroline came barreling down, looking like she'd aged ten years in three minutes.

She shoved a mahogany box into my hands.

"Here.You got what you wanted. Now cancel the bloody call."

I popped the box open and inspected the brooch.

It was intact.

No scratches, no substitutions.

Then I snapped the box shut and turned on my heel.

Caroline came flapping after me like a pissed-off goose.

"Mirabelle! Cancel the damn call! You really want the cops showing up on my doorstep? What will the neighbors think? Do you hear me? Tell them not to come!"

I didn't break stride. Just waved my phone over my shoulder.
"Relax. They're not coming."

I was halfway down the driveway before she even hit the front door.

Once I got a few houses away, I stopped. Turned around.

Three-story homes, all smug and cookie-cutter, lined both sides.

This wasn't the fanciest part of Skyline City, but anyone living here wasn't clipping coupons either.

I grew up here, but that house wasn't mine anymore.

I spun back, power-walked out of the neighborhood, and spotted Ashton's car parked by the curb like a black jaguar waiting to pounce.

I forced my face into something vaguely neutral, slid into the passenger seat, and buckled up.

"Got what you came for?" he asked, eyes flicking to the box.

"Yeah." I set the box on my lap, fingers curling around the carved edges.

He started the engine. "Right. Off to the Office of the City Clerk. No backing out now, Miss Vance."

I nodded. "No backing out."

Once we hit the main road, he glanced over. "So, what was so important you had to show up at the crack of dawn to grab it?"

I ran my thumb along the floral carving on the lid. "It's the engagement gift the Grangers gave me. From back when we were still pretending that was a good idea."

"Oh? The Grangers gave you that?"

I thought I'd caught a slight edge in his voice, but maybe I'd just imagined it.

"Yeah. It's a brooch. Passed down from Aunt Louisa's side. Some kind of family heirloom. Since the engagement's off, I can't keep it. Figured I'd drop it off later. Tie up loose ends, you know. Maybe Aunt Louisa will finally see that I'm serious about the breakup."

"Good idea." He sounded sincere.

The City Clerk's office came into view.
We parked, got out, and headed straight in.

We were first in line.

I had no clue what I was doing.

But Ashton moved like he'd memorized the floor plan and speedran the tutorial.

He knew every window, every form, every "sign here."

He also looked like he was racing a bomb countdown. Just in case I bolted.

Twenty minutes later, I was holding a crisp little piece of legal commitment in both hands.

Outside,I exhaled for the first time all morning.

My death grip on the marriage certificate loosened.⑦

It was just paper.

White. Boring fonts. Embossed stamps. Names, date, time, location, the usual robot-language confirming,yep,we'd officially tied the knot. Signatures. A witness line I hadn't even registered.

Also, surprise-l learned my new husband's full name was Ashton Jules-Sylvain Laurent.

I stared down at his signature like it might bite.

I'd really married him.

Not Rhys Granger. Him.

Was I okay? Unclear.

The whole thing still felt floaty and unreal, like I'd tripped and landed in someone else's life.

We walked side by side to the curb.

I stopped."Umn..."

Should I call him hubby? That sounded weird.

"Mr. Laurent, you go ahead. I'm heading straight to the Grangers."
I was already pulling out my phone to call a cab when he said, "I'm not busy today. I'll drive you."

He opened the passenger door like it was non-negotiable.

I hesitated.
###Chapter 41 Can of Worms
I was about to say no, thanks, we're not that kind of married, but his voice had that corporate don't-argue undertone.


I got in the car. "Thanks. Appreciate it."

He just hummed-barely a sound-already turning the key.



We made it to the next block before he added, like it was some offhand comment, "It's no trouble."

I glanced over.

That chiselled, unreadable side profile gave nothing away. Same as before.

From the moment we walked out with that marriage certificate, he hadn't shown a single flicker.

No awkward laughs, no nervous tics.

Just the same ice-cold poise he probably used to fire underperforming staff.

It weirdly helped.

The more he treated this marriage like a business transaction, the easier it was to breathe.

No romantic pressure. No messy feelings.

Just...clean lines and clear boundaries.
 Then he said, still eyes on the road, "We're married.Driving my wife isn't exactly going above and beyond And you don't need to call me Mr. Laurent anymore.Just use my name."

"Alright... Ashton."

***


I'd been to the Granger house more times than I could count.


Their housekeeper,Darlene,recognized me right away.

She opened the door with a polite smile and a soft,"Miss Vance," like we were old family friends.

"Come in and have a seat, dear. I'll go fetch Mrs.Granger. She's just been discharged from the hospital.I know she'll be thrilled to see you."

"Thanks," I said, settling on the nearest sofa and ignoring the smell of money and over-scented candles.


I didn't even get a sip of water before Willow Granger came swanning down the stairs.

Her face dropped the second she saw me.

"What the hell are you doing here? Rhys doesn't even live here anymore. If you're looking to throw yourself at him, you're at the wrong address."

"I'm not here for Rhys. I came to see Aunt Louisa."

That only made her scowl harder."My mum? Are you serious?"
"Do I look like I'm joking?"

"You look like one of those pathetic women who can't keep their boyfriend in check, so they go crying to mummy for backup. What, hoping she'll slap some sense into him again?"

Again? Did Louisa slap Rhys?

That was interesting.

Willow stepped closer, narrowing her eyes. "Last time,Mum gave Rhys a proper bollocking in the hospital.Isn't that enough? Are you here to open another can of worms?"


"Are you calling yourself a worm?"

Willow looked thrown.

Back when I still thought pleasing Rhys was a viable strategy, I had gone out of my way to be friendly with her.

Now that I wasn't smiling and simpering, she looked at me like I'd grown a second head.

She stomped the rest of the way down and zeroed in on the box I'd placed on the coffee table. "What's that?"

Before | could say a word, she reached out and flipped the lid open.

She stared down at the brooch inside.

Her eyes widened, and she just stood there gawping at it.
"That's... a really pretty brooch. Looks kinda... familiar."Then it hit her.

"Wait! Isn't this the heirloom thing my family gave yours when you and Rhys got engaged?"

I didn't confirm or deny. Just let her stew in it.

Willow, of course, decided that meant		and picked it up without asking for permission.

She held it up to the light. Squinted. Gasped a little.

But then she remembered she hated me and slapped on her best suspicious face.

"So that's why you're here. You're trying to use this to guilt-trip my mum, get her to force Rhys into staying with you. Bet you dragged your parents into it too."

I didn't bother replying.

She put the brooch down, then launched into her big speech. "You don't have to push him so hard,you know. Rhys will marry you. He said he would. That should be enough. He might not love you anymore,but at least he's doing the decent thing. You should just close one eye to him and Catherine, and you can still be my sister-in-law. You'll be the official Mrs.Granger everybody acknowledges."

I stared at her in amazement."God,the way you say that-makes it sound like I'm the mistress."


That shut her up.

Her face turned an awkward shade of pink.
She looked like she wanted to say something clever but couldn't find the script.

Willow muttered after a beat, "Catherine came first.She and Rhys... they're meant to be. You're the one who's interfering.Besides, Rhys wouldn't have looked elsewhere if he were happy at home."

That pissed me off more than I expected.

Not the words.

The smug little philosophy baked into them.

I'd been such an idiot,hadn'tl?

Twisting myself into knots to be nice to this girl-this moral vacuum in designer boots-because | thought it would help with Rhys.

Never again.

I reached out and took the brooch straight from her hand. "Save your lecture. Rhys and I are over."

I'd barely finished the sentence when she scoffed loud enough to wake the dead.

"Yeah right. You're obsessed with him. Everyone knows you'd do anything to get him back. This is just your latest scheme."

Willow flounced onto the sofa like she'd just won something and was waiting for her prize.

We both waited in tense, sparkly silence.

I could feel her watching me from the corner of her eye,like I was about to pull a rabbit-or a prenup-out  of my handbag.

A few minutes later, Louisa appeared at the top of the stairs.

She'd only just been discharged from the hospital, but she looked better than I'd expected-fresh lipstick,silk scarf, no IV drip in sight.

"Mirabelle! I've been meaning to call you-"

Her gaze dropped to the familiar-looking box in front of me.


Her steps slowed.
###Chapter 42 Forgery
I walked over, gently took her arm, and helped her down.

"Aunt Louisa, I came today because... It's about the engagement."

Her face didn't change much, but I watched it like a hawk anyway, ready to call an ambulance if her blood pressure spiked again.

Louisa sighed. "Just say what you need to say. Don't worry, I won't overreact this time."

We sat.

I slid the box across the coffee table.

"This is the brooch you gave me back then. Now that Rhys and I are no longer engaged, it doesn't feel right for me to keep it. I'd also like the gold ring my parents gave your family returned. Let's just make a clean break."

Louisa ran her fingers over the brooch.

Next to her, Willow sat likeshe'd been sculpted from pure snobbery-chin up, shoulders back, eyes full of suspicion.

She still didn't buy it.

She thought I was playing some long con.
 Maybe forcing a breakup to win Rhys back.

Louisa grabbed my hand.

"Are you absolutely sure about this? Rhys isn't perfect,I know. But once you break off the engagement,what happens next? You'll be alone. Everyone in Skyline knows you're his fiancée. They think you've been chasing after him for years."

That was true; I had been chasing after him for years.

"If you walk away now, they'll laugh behind your back.You've got no one to back you up. Have you thought about what that really means?"

"Mum!" Willow snapped. "She's not calling off the engagement, she's pretending to call it off-obviously!It's just another sob story stunt to get a reaction out of you. God knows what game she's playing this time."

"Shut it," Louisa shot her a look sharp enough to peel paint.

I ignored Willow. "Aunt Louisa, you don't have to worry about me. I actually came today with some good news too-l got married."

Instant silence.

Both Granger women froze, mouths slightly open.

Then Willow found her voice and used it to shatter glass. "What the hell are you talking about???"

"I got married. For real." | turned to Louisa. "You don't have to worry. I'll be just fine without Rhys. Better,even."
Willow's face scrunched like she'd just bitten into a lemon. "You're not seriously faking a marriage just to break up Rhys and Catherine, are you?"

"No. Rhys and I are ancient history. Whatever he does with Catherine is none of my business."

I reached into my bag and pulled out the marriage certificate, handing it across the coffee table. "We signed the papers today."

Louisa reached for it, but Willow snatched it away first.

"This is fake," she barked, flipping it over like she was searching for a watermark. "You're full of tricks. No way is this real."

I shrugged."There's no reason to fake it."

She kept squinting at it. "Wait a second... is this-?"

Her eyes bugged out.

She finally looked at the name.

"Ashton Laurent?!"


She screamed it like it burned her tongue.

Then she blinked.

Then she laughed-full witch-cackle.

"Mirabelle Vance! If you're going to fake a marriage,at least use someone believable. Where the hell did you get the nerve to Photoshop Ashton Laurent's name onto a marriage cert? It looks legit, I'll give you that. You must've paid a fortune for the forgery."

Louisa didn't believe it either. "Mirabelle, where did you get this?"

Willow snorted. "Gotta admit, it's a pretty good fake.Who'd you hire, one of those dodgy hacker forums?"

The look she gave me belonged on a mugshot wall,smeared with smugness and judgment.

I ignored her and turned back to Louisa. "Aunt Louisa,come on. Like I'd forge a government document just to get a rise out of you. Especially one with the Laurent name on it. That's not just illegal; it's suicide.You know it. You know me."

I looked her dead in the eye, not even a twitch.

Louisa's lip wobbled.

When the truth of my words hit her, so did the tears."You're really married."

Willow flaited like someone had just hit her with a water balloon. "Mum, are you serious? Don't fall for her crap! If Ashton Laurent married Mirabelle Vance,I'll chop my legs off and moonwalk backwards down Eifth Avenue."

I saw her frantically scrolling through her phone,comparing some internet image to the certificate in front of her.

"If you can prove this certificate's fake," I said,folding my arms, "I'll be the one doing the backwards moonwalk. With no clothes on."

Her face changed by degrees.

First doubt, then panic, then full-blown shock.
 She slumped into the sofa. "This can't be real. Mum.Tell me I'm hallucinating."

Louisa sniffled and grabbed my hand again. "You can't just marry some random stranger to spite Rhys. This is your whole life we're talking about..."

"Ashton's not just some stranger," I said sharply.

I hadn't meant to snap, but something about that sentence rubbed me the wrong way.

Maybe because it wasn't entirely untrue.

"Ashton's young and good-looking and well-known.Definitely not a stranger."

Louisa dabbed her face with a tissue. "I know,sweetheart. He's obviously miles better than Rhys. 1just... I'm scared you acted on impulse. Men like Ashton, they live on another planet. Can someone like that really treat you right?"

"He does treat me right," I said, dead calm.

Which was a big statement, considering l'd barely spent more than some dozen hours with him.

But I wasn't lying.
 ###Chapter 43 Double Standards
I remembered that night at the Laurent party, how he dropped everything the moment I needed to leave.

He canceled the whole party and personally drove me to the hospital.

And that coat. He'd wrapped it around me like I was something worth saving.

Rhys would've let me pass out on the marble floor and asked someone to mop around me.

So yeah.Ashton Laurent was a lot of things. But "just some guy" wasn't one of them.

"He treats me well," I said again, louder this time."Aunt Louisa, I've found something better. You don't need to worry about me anymore."

kouisa's eyes filled up again. "I don't even know what to say. Rhys was never meant for you, I see that now.He's the one who lost out."


I glanced pointedly at the box on the table."Au Louisa..."


She let out a resigned sigh. "I get it. Whatever bond you and Rhys had, it's over. That old keepsake means nothing now. I'll go get it for you."

I watched her climb the stairs, slow and hunched like  the weight of family disappointment was dragging her down.

In my head, I whispered a quiet

The Granger family had already sent out half the wedding invitations with my name stamped next to Rhys's.

Now they'd have to claw them all back, one by one.

And Clive Granger would probably explode.

Louisa would be the first in the blast radius.

I was still chewing on that thought when Willow suddenly let out a snort.

"Didn't peg you for a social climber, Mira. But look at you-bagging Ashton Laurent. Who knew you had it in you?"

Her voice dripped with spite.

Probably because Ashton wasn't just rich and hot; he was the billionaire fantasy every bored socialite dreamed of landing.

Just yesterday,some C-list actress had "accidentally"leaked paparazzi shots of her bumping into him outside a restaurant.


Even someone like Willow had probably entertained the idea of "accidentally" falling into his arms.

And now he was mine.

Well,sort of.

"That day at the hospital," she snapped, eyes  narrowing, "I knew something was off when he showed up with you. Did you seduce him? Got some sleazy photos and blackmailed your way into a ring?Or maybe drugged him-"

My palm connected with her face so fast even I didn't see it coming. "Watch your mouth."

"You just slapped me?" Willow shrieked, springing off the sofa like she'd been electrocuted.

She tried to hit back, but I grabbed her wrist mid-swing.



My nails dug in just enough to make her wince and twist like a squashed bug.

"Last time I didn't hit you back was out of respect for Aunt Louisa. Don't mistake that for weakness. That slap just now was for the filth coming out of your mouth."


I shoved her back onto the sofa.

"I didn't even know Ashton until after I dumped your brother. So maybe back off before you embarrass yourself even more."

"Oh please," she spat. "You expect me to believe you two just happened to fall in love right after the breakup? Spare me. I see right through women like you."

I walked over and picked up the marriage certificate from the table, slipping it back into my bag.

"Your darling brother cheated on me with my sister,and you've got the nerve to come at me? Cute. Either you've got double standards or you genuinely think it's fine for guys to two-time their girlfriends. In that case, I hope your next boyfriend's just like your scumbag brother."

"You-!" Willow turned the color of an overripe tomato.Then she huffed, "Whatever. I'm not wasting my time arguing with you."

"You think you get to call it quits now?" I shot back."Didn't you just say you'd moonwalk backwards if l actually married Ashton? Now that you know the cert's real... I'm still waiting, babe. Moonwalk or coward-pick one."

Willow went silent, pretending she hadn't heard a thing.



Then she cleared her throat, mumbled something about being late for a Pilates class and bolted.

A few minutes later, Louisa came downstairs, holding a ring box.

She handed it to me like it hurt her.

"Even if things didn't work out between you and Rhys,I still think of you as my daughter. Don't be a stranger,alright?"

I nodded."I know, Aunt Louisa."

And I meant it.


She was the only decent Granger in the entire godforsaken gene pool.
I hugged her, promised to keep in touch, then left.

The second I stepped out of that house, it felt like someone had finally cracked open a window.

I could breathe again.

Ashton was waiting for me outside. "All sorted?"

"All sorted." I slid into the passenger seat.

He clocked the ring box immediately.

His eyes flicked down, then back to my face.

I gave it a playful shake.

"The engagement gift," I said. "And now I'm officially Rhys-free."

Ashton leaned in suddenly, close enough that I could feel his breath against my ear.

My heart started pounding.

I stared at him, trying not to blink like a stunned deer.

"What're you doing?" | asked, my voice not nearly as casual as I wanted.

He just smiled and pulled something from behind his back, like a magician pulling a rabbit from a hat.

Except this wasn't a rabbit.

It was a velvet jewelry box.

He popped it open.

Inside was a pendant necklace that made Tiffany's look like Claire's Accessories.

It wasn't showy-no diamonds vomiting from every corner-but the design was clean, elegant, and rich in that quiet,terrifying way.

The stone in the center was pale violet, almost glowing, with flashes of icy blue and silver when it caught the light.

Grandidierite.

Rare as hell.


Stupidly expensive.

Even before he fastened it around my neck,I knew it wasn't something you picked up on a whim.
###Chapter 44Presents
From the delicate curve of the setting to the custom clasp detail, I'd bet my sketchbook it was designed from scratch.

And unless Ashton had been carrying it around for fun,it meant he'd pulled this together in the last few hours.

For me.

My chest tightened like my lungs were being rude and forgetting how to function.

Then he leaned in closer, and suddenly the side of my ear went warm.

I felt something-light, soft, like lips-but it was gone so fast I wasn't sure it had happened.

He reached forward and gently touched the necklace now hanging around my neck.

"That brooch didn't suit you," he said. "This fits better.You like it?"

I managed to find my voice, just barely. "Yeah... I like it."



I hadn't even seen what it looked like on me, but l didn't need a mirror to know it was stunning.

It was the kind of piece that made people stop mid-sentence.
 Ashton gave a little satisfied smile, then his eyes flicked to the ring box still sitting on my lap.

"So I gave you a gift," he said. "Aren't you meant to give me one too?"

I blinked.

I had no idea gift-exchanging was part of the program.

"But I didn't prepare anything. Can I get you something in a few days?"

"But you have one ready," he said, tapping the ring box with a finger. "Give me this."

"What?" I sat up straight. "No, l-"

That ring was from my grandmother

She'd left it to me.

I'd planned to keep it, maybe redesign it one day.

Definitely not give it away

"Let's see what it is," he said.

I opened the box.

The gold band sat quietly inside, old but elegant.

Not pure gold-it had silvery floral etchings around the band that shimmered if you caught them at the right angle.

Ashton's gaze dipped. "This one's nice."

I shrugged. "It's an old style. Not worth much.Probably not your thing."

"But I think it looks good."
 His tone was easy and casual, like he hadn't just put me on the spot.

He didn't push again.

Which somehow made it worse.

Now if I didn't give it to him, I'd look petty.

| hesitated. Overthought. Stared at his annoyingly handsome face while he sat there pretending to be totally chill.

When the silence stretched too long, he said,"If the ring's too valuable and you'd rather get something else for me, I understand. It's fine."

I turned to look at him.

Too valuable?

He must be kidding, and he knew it.

The necklace he gave me was worth a hundred of this ring.

His face was calm, same as always,but there was this...quiet sort of disappointment in his eyes.

Goddammit.

I shoved the box toward him. "Fine. But don't regret it."

"| won't." He took the ring, waited, looked at me expectantly.

When I made no move to put the ring on for him, he slid it onto his ring finger.

It was a little snug, but still looked good on him,because of course it did.
I bit down on my lip. "Might be too small. I can get a new one."

Ashton held up his hand and turned it, checking it out like he'd just scored something from a private auction."Fits fine."

"...Right."

The engine kicked on.

I told him to drop me at Nyx Collective.

On the way, I said, "You don't have to keep calling me Miss Vance, by the way. Especially not in front of people. If we're doing this fake marriage thing,we might as well commit to the bit."

Ashton glanced at me, the corner of his mouth twitching. "What should I call you instead? Mrs.Laurent?"

I rolled my eyes. "Just call me by my name

He nodded. "Mirabelle? Or... Mira?"

I felt that.

Like-actual physical reaction.

Full-body static, tingly as hell.

Just one word and my brain went straight to the gutter-like, zero detours.

I could totally picture him saying my name like that in bed,slow and low, all heat and hands and messed-up sheets.

I clamped my legs together on reflex and stared hard out the car window, praying he hadn't seen my face go up in flames.

"Yeah... Mira's... Mira's fine."

We were about halfway there when he asked, "Still not doing the wedding?"

"Wedding?" I blinked. "Yeah. Still a no."

This whole thing was a contract with a one-year expiration date.

A wedding reception would've turned it into front-page fodder for weeks.

He went quiet for a second, then said. "Alright.Whatever you want."

The mention of the wedding reminded me of why he'd agreed to go along.

I turned to him. "When are we visiting your grandfather?"

"What?"


"You said he wanted to see you get married before he.I'd have thought he'd want to meet me."

"That... Right, he would love to meet you. I'll talk to his, ah, doctors and see about arranging a visit."

"Is he staying at a hospital then?"

"A sanatorium. His condition doesn't permit him to move about much."

"I should bring something. What kind of presents will he like?"
A smile entered his voice. "Your presence alone will suffice to make his day. That, and the wedding certificate."


"Got it." I couldn't tear my eyes off the rearview mirror.

The pendant necklace looked like something I'd have designed in a fever dream-if I had fifty years of experience, a royal jeweler for a mentor, and spent my childhood playing dress-up with the Crown Jewels.

The car slowed as we neared Nyx Collective.

"Give me a sec." I took out the marriage certificate,snapped a couple photos.

Ashton glanced over.

I gave a sheepish grin. "Promised Yvaine I'd text her as soon as we got it done. Forgot earlier."

He just hummed.

Once the car stopped, I jumped out.

As I walked off, I caught a glimpse of Ashton still sitting there, holding his own certificate like he was reading between the lines.
###Chapter 45Ashton's POV: Celebratio..
Ashton watched Mira snap photos of the marriage certificate.


When she mentioned Yvaine, he'd had the dumbest thought: I want to show someone too.

That's how he ended up calling Cassian Langford.

"Drinks tonight. The Rookery. Nine."

At 9:02 p.m., Cassian was there in their usual private room, already half a bottle deep and complaining.

"You ghost me yesterday, drag me out tonight, and now we're just... sitting? Mate, what's the deal? And where's the rest of the crew?"


Ashton had barely opened his mouth when Cassian suggested, "Should I call in a couple of waiters to play Omaha or something? This is tragic."

"Go ahead."


Two waiters came in and shuffled cards.

Ashton sat to Cassian's left, casually placing his right hand on the table.

Right in Cassian's line of sight.

The ring wasn't just visible-it practically screamed.

Cassian squinted. "What the hell's that on your hand?"
ring. Just got it today. Haven't resized itt yet."

Cassian tossed back his drink. "Who gave you a ring?""My wife."

"Your-wait-your what?"

Cassian shot upright like the chair was electrified.

"Did you hit your head? Are you high? Who the fuck is your wife?"

Ashton's lips twitched.

He pulled the marriage certificate-now laminated-from his inner jacket pocket and slid it across the table like it was an ace of spades.

Cassian stared for a full thirty seconds.

Then he picked it up gingerly with two fingers as if it might explode.

"Mirabelle Vance?" he read, syllable by syllable.

His eyes glazed over.

One hand went to his temple as if he was about to faint.

"Have I forgotten how to read? Is this real?"

Ashton snatched the certificate back before the grease from Cassian's fingers could do any damage.

He tucked it away with care.

"You read it right."

Cassian let out a howl that shook the chandelier. "You are married?!"
Ashton took a lazy sip of his whisky. "Why? Jealous?"

"Jealous? Mate, I'm traumatized!"

Cassian dropped into his chair as if his legs had given out, arms sprawled on either side as he stared at Ashton like he'd sprouted an alien head.

"Have you lost your bloody mind? Everyone and their therapist knows Mirabelle Vance is tangled up with Rhys Granger. And you married her? I thought you were going to die single. You didn't even say a word to me before signing the damn papers?"

Ashton flicked him a look like he was slow-witted."She and Rhys broke up ages ago. Called off the engagement. Why can't I marry her? What,you want her to wear widow's weeds for life?"

"That's not what l-" Cassian grabbed the glass of water as if it was vodka and chugged half of it. "But how the hell did this even happen? Don't tell me she conned you."

"She didn't con me," Ashton said coolly. "I conned her."

Cassian froze. "Come again? You conned her? How?"

"I told her my family's been harassing me to get married."

Cassian flung his arms up like a referee calling foul."Who in the Laurent dynasty would dare harass you?You're just out here lying to innocent women for sport now?"

Ashton caressed the ring on his finger. "I also said my grandfather's dying. Guilt-tripped her for sympathy points."

Cassian's jaw dropped. "Your grandfather's got chronic gout, not terminal cancer. When was he dying?"

"He dies when I need him to."

Cassian stared at him in silence.

Honestly, what the fuck.

"You're a psychopath. A literal villain. This is fraud.You should be in prison."

Ashton let out a dismissive snort through his nose. 2He didn't even try to deny it.

Cassian suddenly sprang forward. "Hold up. This doesn't make any sense. You've been hung up on someone for years and suddenly-poof-over it in a week back home?"


Ashton's mouth curved. "I didn't get over her."

"Wait... what?" Cassian's brows nearly hit his hairline.

Ashton leaned back. "It's her. Mirabelle."

Cassian stared, completely blanking for a second."Mirabelle? I thought the girl you were obsessed with was in Italy. You told me so yourself."

"She's not from Italy. She went to Italy. That's where I met her."

Cassian flung an arm out and waved away the two waiters. "Out. Door. Now."

They scrambled.
He slammed the door shut.


"Poker's off?" Ashton deadpanned.

"Screw poker. Start talking."

Ashton chuckled under his breath. "It was Florence.Seven years ago. I met her at an international jewellery design competition."

Cassian blinked. "Seven years-wait, that means she was what, sixteen, seventeen? Jesus. You were-dude,you were an adult. That's-"

Ashton smacked his arm.

Not hard. Just enough to shut himn up.

"Ow! Assault!"

"She was still in school. Finalist in the under-twenty category. I was there as a sponsor. We spoke for maybe five seconds. That was it."

Cassian grabbed the bottle, poured one for Ashton,then himself. "So what, it was love at first sight?"

Ashton stared at the glass. Then shook his head. "No.Not love. Not then. She was-almost grown, but still figuring herself out. I remembered her, yeah. But it didn't hit me then. Not really."

"So when did it?"

"Second time.Eindhoven."

Cassian clicked his fingers. "I remember. You'd already built a damn empire in Europe. Moved your headquarters to Eindhoven, right?" He nudged Ashton  with a smirk. "And I remember the queue of men and women lining up to get in your bed. Some even tried flirting with me, thinking I was the side door to the main event."


Ashton scoffed.

Yeah,Cassian wasn't wrong.

Back then, Ashton had been in his mid-twenties,drowning in attention from people who saw his money and assumed he was easy prey.

He was young. Alone in Europe. Surrounded by staff,assistants,hangers-on-but no family, no safety net.

Even with all his paranoia, there had been moments when his guard slipped.

One night, it did.

It was a party.

Fancy venue, expensive wine, fake smiles

He'd been careful-he was always careful-but someone still managed to drug his drink.

He'd fought through it, barely stayed on his feet,stumbled out of the hotel like a drunk boxer in the twelfth round.


And ran straight into her.
###Chapter 46Ashton's POV:Marriage I...
Cassian frowned. "Hold on. I visited you a couple of times in Eindhoven. You never said you knew Mirabelle.I never even heard you mention her name."

"I didn't know it was her," Ashton said.

All he remembered from that night was the woman-warm skin, steady arms-who must've noticed something was wrong with him.

She'd taken him to the hospital. Paid the bill.

Then disappeared.

"When I woke up," Ashton said, "she was already gone."

Cassian blinked. "So how the hell did you know it was her?"

"I had my assistant look into it."

The moment he saw the photo-Mirabelle Vance,design student at Eindhoven University-he knew.

That was her.

The girl from Florence.

The one with the quiet fire in her eyes.

Cassian leaned in, eyes gleaming. "And then? You tracked her down and asked her out?"

"You got the first part right."
He did track her down. He had to.

But he never approached her.

Not then.

There were too many eyes on him. Too many knives out.

He didn't want her anywhere near the blast zone.

Then business exploded.

His life became airports, mergers, new markets.

By the time he could think about her again, she was back in Skyline City.

And engaged to Rhys bloody Granger.

Still, he couldn't forget her.

Cassian drained his drink and slapped his own forehead."Wait! So all those calls you made to me, protending you cared about gossip-Skyline's charity galas,who wore what, who was dating who-that was all about her?"

Ashton gave him a look."Since when do you know me to give a shit about gossip?"

Cassian barked a laugh. "Ha. So you weren't just nosing around Skyline's corporate scene.You were low -key stalking Mirabelle."

"It wasn't stalking."

"Right," Cassian drawled. "You landed back in Skyline less than twenty-four hours after I mentioned the rumours. Not suspicious at all."

Ashton didn't reply.

The moment Cassian told him what he'd heard-that things between Mirabelle and Rhys Granger were spiraling, that Granger had his eye on someone else,that he'd only proposed because his family twisted his arm-Ashton felt something crack open inside him.

Something dark and stupid and completely impossible to ignore.

She wasn't happy.

She wasn't living the glossy, charmed life he'd imagined.



And that changed everything.

He hadn't planned on coming back.

He'd built a whole empire from scratch. all of it his own,none of it tainted by his family's maddling hand.

But the second he heard Rhys Granger might be out of the picture, he was on the mext flight back.

Everything that followed was scripted. Comtrolled.Calculated.

Mirabelle-sharp, lovely, frustratingly trusting-ended up married to him in less time than it took most people to choose a phone plan.

A few conversations, a little emotional pressure,and the perfect storm of heartbreak and rebound... boom.Married.

Of course, he knew she wasn't over Granger. Not really.
 He wasn't an idiot.

She hadn't married him because she loved him.

She'd married him because she was cornered, and he'd offered her a way out.

But love could be built. Brick by brick. Kiss by kiss.

He'd take the cracks Rhys left behind and fill them with gold if that's what it took.

He didn't care how long it took.

Cassian was two bottles deep and halfway through his third by the time it finally sank in-this wasn't a prank.

Ashton Laurent, their resident forever-bachelor,had actually gone and got himself hitched.

Not fake-married. Not some stunt. Married-married

The smug bastard didn't stop at flashing the ring either.



He'd pulled out the marriage certificate like it was a business card.

Stamped,signed,government-issued.

Looked legit enough, at least to Cassian's booze-blurred eyes.

"Congrats, I guess," Cassian muttered. "If it makes you happy.You finally bagged the girl."

Ashton clinked glasses with him. "I amhappy."

Cassian slapped a palm to his forehead. "Bloody hell,I knew something was off. You moved too fast! I didn't even get to throw you a stag do."
 "You know I don't care about that sort of thing."

"Mate. It's not for you. It's for us-your mates-to gather and mourn your freedom. A symbolic send-off before you're locked in the eternal tomb of marriage."

Ashton just shrugged. "I'll live."

"Yeah, but what about the wedding?" Cassian waved a hand at the paper. "Sure, that cert looks all official,but you're not about to flash it every time someone asks if you're single. You need a reception."

Ashton's smile dipped. "There's no wedding."

Cassian squinted. "What, like... is that a new thing now?No ceremony? Not even a quiet one at City Hall with the fam?"


"She doesn't want a wedding."

Cassian snorted. "Every girl wants a wedding. That's literally what the industry was invented for."

"Maybe."

Ashton remembered those bridal magazines stacked on Mirabelle's kitchen counter in her old apartment.

The bookmarked dress pages.

The notes on flower combos.

She'd tossed everything out when she moved.

Cassian gave him a nudge, half-drunk. "You sure about the whole no wedding thing?"

"Not for now."


But there would be one.
That was the plan.

If he played his cards right-and didn't piss her off too much in the meantime-there'd be vows.

There'd be flowers.

There'd be Mirabelle in white, walking toward him for real this time.

Cassian burped. Loudly. "No wedding, no gift, yeah?That's how this works. No open bar, no obligation.I don't get to chat up the bridesmaids, you don't get a toaster."


"Fine. You're off the hook for the gift." Ashton leaned forward. "But I need you to do something for me."

Cassian perked up like a retriever. "Anything, bro."

"You're a gossip."

Cassian looked wounded. "Excuse you. I'm a high-end information distributor."


"Whatever. I need you to do your thing. Start leaking the news. Casual-like. When you're chatting to people,just drop it in-'Oh, didn't you hear? Ashton and Mirabelle got married. Someone saw them at the clerk's office.' That sort of thing."

Cassian blinked. "You want me to start a rumour? But I thought you wanted to keep it low profile. Hence no wedding."

That wasn't his call.

That was Mirabelle's request.
No big splash, no media circus, no kiss-the-bride headlines.

Ashton had respected that.

But he needed her to start seeing this marriage not as a temporary contract, not as an expediency,but as real.


Permanent.


A done fucking deal.

He looked Cassian deadin the eye. "Just do it."

###Chapter 47Midnight Oil
I stayed late at Nyx Collective.

Midnight late.

Everyone else had left hours ago, but I was still at my desk, hunched over my laptop.

Technically, I was working.

Realistically? I was hiding.

From Ashton.

From the terrifying possibility that he might suggest we consummate our brand-new, totally normal,definitely not weird marriage with a roll in the hay.

Because I was scared I'd say yes without blinking.

Or worse-what if I was the one to bring it up?

Sure,we were legally husband and wife now.

But the only time we'd actually slept together,I'd been blackout drunk and didn't even know his name.

Still, from the fragments I did remember, he'd been..insane. Stupidly good.

The kind of good that ruins porn for you.

Like, knew what to do with his lips and hands and tongue and you-know-what good.

And okay, yes, my libido wanted an encore.
 A sober one


But the rest of me was terrified I'd come on too strong, act like some unhinged nympho, and scare him off

I mean. I did rip his shirt that night

That's not exactly first-date energy.

He'd been very professional about this whole contract marriage thing.

So I needed to be professional, too.

Which is why I was still at Nyx, doodling nonsense on my sketchpad, pretending I cared about bezel settings and chain lengths when really, I just didn't want to go home.


Eliza Black was coming in a few days to pick her lead designer.

No pressure or anything.

My brain had been flatlining all week, but the pendant necklace had given me some inspiration which l needed to jot down before it vanished.

I'd shut off all the lights except one, because mood lighting helped.

Close to one o'clock, I had just stretched and cracked my spine in five places when I heard the door open quietly.

I turned and cocked an eyebrow.

What was she doing here?
Violet Lin had left hours earlier.

Apparently,she was just as surprised to see me as l was to see her.

"Oh wow, working late?" she said, pulling up short when she saw me stand up.

I gave her a side-eye, sat back down, clicked my mouse, and shut down the deck I had been working on.

She didn't need to see anything.

She noticed my move and scoffed. "Please.Like I care what you're working on. We both know you're just killing yourself over that Eliza Black pitch. I already finished mine. Not that I'd waste my time looking at yours. I will get the project, by the way. You should just quit now. Save yourself the heartbreak. Nothing worse than crying over a dead dream."

I turned my chair slowly to face her.Leaned back.

"If I get it, great. If I don't, whatever. It's one project.I don't treat it like it's the last golden ticket out of my tragic little life. That level of desperation kinda reeks.If anyone's crying when Eliza picks someone else,it's going to be you,sweetheart."

Violet's jaw clenched so hard I half-expected her teeth to crack.

She stormed closer, heels stabbing the floor like she was trying to kill it.

"I'm not desperate," she hissed. "Even if I don't get this, I've got backup. Unlike you, l've got options.I  could quit tomorrow and still be fine. Hell, I could buy Nyx Collective if I wanted and fire your smug face just for fun."


"Cool. So why are you here at midnight talking to me instead of doing rich-girl Pilates or whatever?"

Her nostrils flared.


I smiled.


She didn't.

"Your folks made some cash riding the post-pandemic crypto wave. Big whoop. Doesn't change the fact they're still new money. If your family had the power you're flexing, why didn't they even get an invite to the Laurents' gala, hmm? And while we're at it, you still haven't told me how you got in. What was it-snuck in under the dessert cart?"

Her face dropped."You-!"

"Yes?"

She glared like she was seconds from launching her kouboutins at me, then hissed, "You'll regret this," and stomped out.

I watched her go, head tilted.

A minute after she left, I grabbed my bag and followed.



Something about her showing up after hours, all flustered, didn't sit right with me.

Violet Lin didn't do unannounced pop-ins without a reason, and her face when she saw me earlier was straight-up guilty

I slipped downstairs, low heels silent on the marble.

She'd already reached the lobby, deep in conversation with one of the security guards.

I ducked behind the stairwvell, the one blind spot in the CCTV coverage, discovered thanks to three months of staying late and pure paranoia.

She handed the guy a card.

Not the kind to access the building, the kind you swipe on a POS terminal.

The guard-his name was Jace, I think-had started last month.

Baby-faced, couldn't have been more than twenty-five.



Clean-cut,twitchy,the type who still apologized when people bumped into him.

More importantly, not the rich type.

Normally, Violet wouldn't chat up someone like him.

No way she was down here chatting him up for fun.

Jace tried to push the card away, but Violet said something too low for me to catch, then he pocketed the card, but not before he darted his eyes around,guilt written all over his face.

I ducked down before he could see me and connected the dots.

Violet was paying him off to erase security footage.
Only security and management had access to the surveillance tapes.

If she wanted something wiped, she had to go through him. Or Savannah.


Which meant her little detour upstairs had been a recon mission-to check if the office was empty, and if by luck, Savannah had forgotten to lock her door.

But the moment she saw me, she changed her plan.

I waited for her to leave before heading back upstairs to pack up.

But not before I checked my phone and made sure l got what I wanted.
###Chapter 48Rhys's POV: Damage...
The Granger family living room looked like a war zone -overturned vases, a half-shattered wine glass bleeding red across the rug, and a smashed photo frame face-down on the floor, glass splinters glittering like shrapnel.

Clive Granger's slap cracked through the air.should've had a vasectomy.'

Rhys winced, hand on his cheek. 'Il just thought-'

'You thought?' Another slap. 'You thought wrong,dumbass. You said Mirabelle was obsessed with you.That she'd still marry you even if you were screwing your way through Skyline. And now what? She's walked. You couldn't even keep a woman. Jesus, Rhys,I can't walk anywhere without someone stopping me fo ask about you and Catherine Vane. Everyone knows.'

'Um, we never actually told anyone about-'

'Bullshit!' Clive's palm met skin again.

Rhys's head snapped sideways.

He didn't fight back. Wouldn't dare.

Not when his dad looked one blood vessel away from a cardiac arrest.

'You think people are blind?' Clive yelled. You  embarrassed this family at the Laurents' party. Hell,even their dog probably knows what you've been up to. And now you're standing there pretending like you've been all discreet and under the radar? Pathetic.




Rhys just stood there,head bowed.

Clive turned on Louisa next. 'And you just handed over the ring? Are you out of your mind? That thing was the only leverage we had. She gives it back,wedding's officially dead.'

Louisa crossed her arms. 'She brought the marriage certificate. What do you expect me to do-eat the paper and pretend it never existed?'

Clive slammed the table so hard the crystal tray jumped. 'Mirabelle Vance is a brat. Getting secretly married? She clearly thinks our family's a joke. Did her parents forget to teach her basic respect?'

Louisa sat down. 'Don't drag Mira into this. You know damn well who the problem is. If your golden boy wasn't out playing sugar daddy to every influencer with a fake tan, maybe Mirabelle wouldn't have snapped. You want someone to blame? Look in the mirror. He's your clone, Clive-arrogant,spoiled,and dumb enough to light a match in a gas leak.'

Clive's mouth opened, then shut.

Louisa's eyes were drilling holes into her husband.'Rhys clearly inherited your talent for screwing around.
 
Clive looked away. 'What kind of nonsense is that supposed to be?'

'You kept a side piece for years,' Louisa said with a bitter little laugh. 'And surprise, surprise, your son turned out just like you.'

'You-' Clive's voice cracked like old wood.

Willow jumped in. 'Mum, stop. Dad cut things off with that woman ages ago.'

Louisa's eyes glossed over with rage.

She jerked her arm free from Willow's grip.

Willow tried again, desperate now. 'The problem isn't some ancient fling. It's that Mirabelle married someone else. That's why Dad's losing it.

'And she bloody well should have!' Louisa hissed.'She's too good for your brother anyway.

Rhys gave Willow a look, one of those silent 'get her out of here before someone has an aneurysm'expressions.

Willow caught it and looped an arm around Louisa.

'Mum, come upstairs. Doc said you shouldn't get worked up again so soon after getting out of the hospital. Why don't you come and see something I've got? I went to that new spa today,and they gave me a face mask that's basically Botox in a jar. You've got to try it.'

She hustled Louisa out, talking about serums and collagen like their family wasn't currently imploding.

As soon as they'd disappeared upstairs, Clive turned to  Rhys. 'My study. Now.'

'Mirabelle's married,' Clive said as soon as the study door was shut. 'The wedding's off. Invitations are already out. How do you plan on cleaning up this circus?'

Rhys stared at the mahogany desk like it had answers.'I'll just. tell everyone it's cancelled?'

Clive looked ready to strangle him with a Hermès tie.'The whole of Skyline City thinks you cheated on her.Do you have any idea what this does to the Granger name?'

Rhys shrugged. 'We'll survive. We've survived worse.'In his head, he still believed his mum had a point-if his dad could parade a mistress around back in the day and still close deals like nothing happened,why was everyone acting like his thing with Catherine was some moral apocalypse?

At least Catherine was his actual soulmate.

Mirabelle had been forced on him by his parents, a fiancée he'd never even wanted.


Now that Mirabelle was out and Catherine was back,everything felt right again. Balanced.

Like the universe had finally course-corrected.

Rhys genuinely didn't get what all the fuss was about.

Clive let out a loud,weary sigh.

A sigh filled with disappointment.
Rhys didn't miss it.

If anything, it fuelled the slow-burn fury he'd been stewing in all day.

It was all Mirabelle's fault, really.

She hadn't even given him a warning before she'd gone and married herself off.

Like,what the hell?

She used to follow him around like a puppy in heels.

Wide eyes, soft voice, always so eager to please.

Even when he messedup-especially when he messed up-she forgave him with this ridiculous belief that he'd eventually grow up.

And now she was someone else's wife.

Rhys's jaw clenched.

His fingers drummed on the edge of the armchair like they were itching to hit something.

Fine. She wanted to play dirty?

So could he.

His dad finally spoke. 'Thanks to your personal soap opera, people are saying the Grangers don't honour deals. That we break promises. Three contracts dead in the water this month.'

He looked at his only son. 'Now do you see what the big deal is?'
 ###Chapter 49Rhys's POV: Shift the Story
Rhys's head whipped up. "That's not on us. I didn't cancel the wedding. Nor did I say I wouldn't marry her.She's the one who ran off and got married."

Clive swore. "Sure. But the part where you were screwing your ex-girlfriend while still engaged to Mirabelle-that wasn't private. Everyone thinks she left because you cheated."

Rhys's mouth stayed shut this time.

Fine, maybe he had been a bit hasty in getting back together with Catherine.

But he'd figured Mirabelle would throw a fit, shed some tears.


He didn't think she'd actually leave.

Clive leaned back. "The engagement's off. Fine. But we're not taking the fall for this."

Rhys looked up, hopeful. "What does that mean?"

"We shift the story. Say she cheated first. Say she couldn't wait, jumped ship, married the first man who winked at her. You're the loyal one. The victim."

"I...I thought you liked her."

Clive glared at his son. "I did, but I like my reputation intact and my investments protected more."
Rhys licked his lips. "You do realize the guy she married is a Laurent. If we start spinning this, doesn't that make him the other man? Ashton's not exactly going to let that slide."

"We don't say who. Just that Mirabelle cheated. Keep the guy out of it." Clive sneered. "Do you honestly think Ashton married her for love?"


"Of course not," Rhys said immediately.

There was no world where someone like Ashton would willingly choose a girl like Mirabelle.

Clive gave a thin smile. "They got the license quietly.No press, no photos. The Laurents haven't said a word.That means Ashton doesn't want to acknowledge the marriage publicly. He doesn't want toacknowledge her. If the vultures come for her, he probably won't lift a finger."

His tone turned calculating. "As long as we don't name Ashton, all the dirt will land on her. That's the only way to clean the Granger name.You get that,right?"Rhys nodded slowly. "Yeah. I get it."

"Good. Meanwhile, you stay away from Catherine.Keep your head down. Look heartbroken. Let people think Mirabelle is the one who wronged you. Play the wounded ex. You can at least manage that, can't you?"

Rhys muttered, "Yeah...sure."

He left the Granger townhouse fuming.

All of this was Mirabelle's fault.
 Who the hell gave her permission to dump him first?

If anyone was ending that engagement, it should've been him.

She stole his thunder.


"If you did it to piss me off," he muttered to himself,"congrats, babe. Goal achieved."





When he got back to his penthouse, Catherine was lounging on the cream leather sofa in his hoodie,scrolling on her phone.

"You should skip the office this week," Rhys said without preamble, dumping his keys on the counter."Actually, screw it, take a trip. Paris, Bali, wherever.Just leave Skyline for a while."

Catherine looked up, surprised."Why?"

"Because we need to chill. My parents are breathing down my neck. People are watching."

Her smile started to crack at the edges. "But I thought you'd talk to your parents, tell them you and Mirabelle are done. That you're with me now."

"Just do what I say," he snapped.

"But|-"


He glared at her.


"France sounds lovely." She swallowed her objection.

"But for how long?"

Rhys came over and gave her cheek a light pinch.
"That's what I love about you. You don't kick up a fuss."

She smiled.

He stood up. "What's for dinner?"

"What?" She was thrown. "I, ah, I thought you were going to eat with your parents. I didn't-"

"Never mind. Just order me some takeout." He went into the bathroom and took a shower.


When he came out, Catherine said, "Food's arriving in fifteen minutes."

"That long?" He frowned. "You should've ordered from the restaurant across the street."

"I'll remember that next time."

Padding over to the fridge, he hunted down an orange and tossed it to Catherine. "Peel this, will you?"

She did.

He'd just popped a few orange slices into his mouth when his stomach cramped hard.

Sharp,twisting,like someone had laced the fruit with knives.

"Shit," he muttered, pressing a hand to his abdomen.

"Gastritis acting up again?" Catherine jumped up.

"Where's your med?"

He pointed to the bathroom.

She rushed in and came out thirty seconds later."Here,take these. And if it gets worse, we're going straight to the hospital."
 She plonked the H2 blockers and a glass of water down in front of him.

Rhys stared at them.

Catherine sat down, her job done. "Must be the stress getting to you. Maybe you should come to France with me. You know, clear your head,get a break from Mirabelle. Seriously, I don't get what she's playing at.Marrying some random guy just to get under your skin?Pathetic."

Rhys was barely listening.

He stared at the blister pack, made a move to reach it,but groaned when a fresh wave of agony hit him.

Mirabelle used to do this too-only different.

She'd crack the pills out of the blister pack and place them in his mouth.


Then she'd tip the water to his lips, hand on his back to keep him anchored.


All he had to do was lie there and swallow.

Catherine didn't do any of that.

She hadn't even opened the damn foil.

Rhys didn't say anything

Wouldn't be fair to go off over something this minor.Still. It bugged him.

"Rhys? Are you listening?" Catherine waved a hand in front of his face. "I was thinking... which part of France should I even go to? I'm bored of Paris, Cannes was too humid, and Saint-Tropez is full of influencers.Maybe somewhere low-key,like Biarritz?"

"Whatever," he muttered.

"Hmm? Or should I just borrow your family's chateau in Bordeaux again? Thoughts?"

"Wherever you want to go is fine," he said. "Just go check online for tickets."

The second Catherine hit the shower, Rhys grabbed his phone, found Mirabelle's number, hit call.

If Mirabelle answered and apologized-fine.

He could let go of the whole quickie marriage stunt.

Ashton could be her rebound or whatever.

Once she got over herself and filed the divorce papers,there was still a spot waiting for her.

He was still willing to give her the title of Mrs. Granger despite all the trouble she'd stirred up.

As long as she didn't expect affection or bedtime cuddles, they'd be just fine.

The call didn't go through, went straight to a busy tone.


Rhys blinked.

Then remembered-oh. She'd blocked him. Again.

He dialed Yvaine next.

One ring.

Click. Call ended.
What the hell?

He called again.

This time it didn't even ring. Straight to voicemail.

He was blocked.

"Fuck!" he shouted,hurling the phone across the room.

Next morning, he sent someone to stake out Nyx Collective.


Wait for Mirabelle to leave work. Follow her. Get a location.


By sunset,he had it.

He drove to Oakwood Apartments, some mid-rise thing near the park.

On the way there, he called in a favor,pulled a few strings, got access to the building and a lift pass to her floor.

He got in the lift.
###Chapter 50Midnight Visit
I was half-dead on the couch, scrolling through dog videos for inspiration, when someone started pounding on the door.

I hadn't ordered food. Yvaine wasn't coming tonight.

And you needed a building pass just to get on my floor,so that left...

Sighing,I opened the door.

Yep.Rhys Granger,Looking like someone had pissed in his Cristal.

"Nope," I said immediately and went to slam it shut.

He shoved a foot in. "You dodging me now? I've got something to say!"

"Say it. Then leave."

"If you married that guy just to spite me, you win. Fine.You win. I'm here now. You got what you wanted."

I laughed. "You think I got married to piss you off?"

"Didn't you?" he said, jaw tight. "You've been into me since we were kids. You don't just flip a switch and stop. Everything you're doing right now is just a game."Oh, for fuck's sake.

I folded my arms. "Rhys, the day you let my darling sister crawl into your lap at that bar was the day l stopped liking you. Yeah, I used to be an idiot. But I'm not anymore. So let me make this crystal clear."

He blinked.


I leaned forward.

"I. Am. Married. I have a husband. A real one. Not a maybe-one-day-if-you-behave placeholder. You and I? We're nothing. I don't love you. I don't even like you now. Got it? Is that enough closure for you?"

Rhys just stood there, shoulders slumped, mouth half -open.


Good. Let it sting.

His breathing went weird, like someone had stuffed a sock down his throat.


"No. No way. You can't not love me." He sounded like a broken chatbot. "You marrying Ashton Laurent?That was the real joke. You think the heir to the Laurent empire's actually gonna fall for you? Maybe he played along for now 'cause you blackmailed him or whatever, but once he comes to his senses,you won't even know what hit you before you're out on your arse-or dead."

I looked up at the ceiling, praying for patience.

Why the hell did I never notice how exhausting it was just talking to Rhys?

I'd said what I needed to say.

I wasn't wasting another breath.
"Do not come back here," I said, then turned and slammed the door-

Well, I tried to slam it.

Except his foot was still in the gap.

There was a solid "crunch."

Followed by the kind of scream that probably made my neighbors reach for their phones.

"AAAAAHH!! My foot!! Mirabelle, are you trying to murder me?!"


I glanced down.

His polished leather shoe had a dent, but I didn't see blood or bone fragments.

"Move it," I said coolly. "Or next time I'll snap the whole damn thing."

"No!" Rhys gritted his teeth and clung to the doorframe.


He grabbed my wrist hard and yanked me out into the hallway. "You think you can just shut the door on me?I'm not done talking!"

"Let go of me!" I twisted, tried to pull free, but his grip was vice-tight

I could feel it pressing straight into the bone. "Rhys!You're hurting me, you lunatic!"

He didn't reply. It was like he'd gone full zombie mode and couldn't hear me.

Worse-he started dragging me towards the lift.
"You're coming home with me!"

"The hell I am! Let go!"

I was debating if kneeing him in the groin was worth a trip to the police station when the lift let out a cheerful "ding."

Ashton strode out, stopped short at the sight of us,then picked up his pace.

He was right in front of me in a matter of seconds and landed a punch straight into Rhys's face.

Rhys made a choked-up sound, somewhere between a yelp and a dying pigeon.

Then Ashton grabbed his shirt collar with one hand and clamped down on Rhys's wrist with the other.

He yanked him clean off me like peeling off a cheap sticker.


"Who the fuck are you?!" Rhys gasped, hunched over like a kicked bin.


He looked dazed, probably couldn't see past the cartoon stars circling his head.

Ashton's voice came down like a guillotine: "Lay a hand on her again, and I'll kill you."

Rhys spat out a mouthful of blood.

He tried squinting up at the newcomer's face.

I knew the moment he recognized Ashton, because he flinched.

And I couldn't blame him.
Even I was a little scared.

Ashton had delivered his threat in a perfectly calm voice, and something told me he'd have no trouble carrying it out.

Rhys, for all his puffed-up ego, couldn't even stand straight.

Panicking, he backed away a step and shouted, as if volume could make up for his lack of courage,"Mirabelle is my fiancée! What I do with her is none of your business!"

That last part came out about three decibels softer than the rest.

Even Rhys himself didn't believe it

Ashton took a step forward.

Rhys scrambled back farther.

Ashton parked himself right in front of me like a six-foot human wall.

"Mirabelle is my wife. You show up at my place in the middle of the night harassing her, and you think that's got nothing to do with me?"

Rhys swallowed. Loudly.

I could hear it from behind Ashton's shoulder.

Even when he straightened up and tried to match Ashton's height, he still had to tip his chin up just to make eye contact.

"You didn't marry her willingly, right? If she's got  something on you-pictures, whatever-l can help. She blackmailed you, didn't she?"

Wow. Willow Granger really had him out here reading off a script.

They'd convinced themselves I'd somehow blackmailed Ashton into marrying me.

What did they think I had on him? Dick pics? The nuclear launch codes?


I poked my head out from behind Ashton. "You are delusional."


Gently,Ashton nudged me back.

The next second,his fist connected with Rhys's other cheek.Dead center.

Now his face was finally symmetrical. Swollen on both sides like a rotten melon.
###Chapter 51Execution Mode
Rhys staggered backward, arms flailing like someone had yanked the battery out of his spine.

Ashton didn't let up.

While Rhys was still figuring out which direction gravity was pulling him, Ashton calmly slipped off his watch and shoved it into his pocket.

Then he cracked his neck and grabbed Rhys by the collar.


And started swinging.


One punch.


Then another.


And another.

Until | lost count.

Until Rhys was spitting blood and barely able to stand,his body folding like wet cardboard.

And Ashton still wasn't done.


He let Rhys drop like a sack of compost.

Then he strolled over and stomped on him in the gut.

Not once.
Repeatedly.
Real slow. Real controlled.

Every hit drew another mouthful of blood from Rhys.like some horrific vending machine

"Ashton!"| lunged forward, grabbing his arm with both hands. "Jesus, you'll kill him! Stop!"

He turned to look at me.


I almost flinched.


His eyes were so blue they were almost black,holding a kind of still fury that made my stomach twist.

I'd seen him angry before, but this was something else.

This was execution mode.

My fingers trembled on his arm, and I let go.

"Ashton,please stop."

If he didn't, I might have to come to Rhys's defense,as much as I hated the idea.

But whatever switch had flipped inside him... switched back.

His face emptied out. Blank again.

He blinked once, and the violence vanished.

Then he looked at mny wrist, the one Rhys had grabbed earlier.


He stepped closer and took it in his hand like it was made of glass.


His thumb brushed over the skin.


I didn't need a mirror to know it looked bad-deep red, starting to purple, ugly against my pale skin

"He hurt you," he said in a soft voice,way too soft for someone who just played Mortal Kombat with my ex.

"I'm fine. It's nothing. Looks worse than it is." I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened just slightly.

Not rough. Just firm enough to stop me.

"Come with me," he said. "I'll put something on it."

He started walking me toward his flat like it was already decided.

Which,knowing him,it probably was.

Behind us, Rhys groaned like a dying raccoon.

Then his voice came out, all wet and wheezy.

"You... you can't do this... this is assault... I'll call the cops... I'm calling the fucking cops..."

He reached for his pocket with a shaky hand, only to realize his phone had flown halfway down the hallway.

It was lying in the corner, completely out of reach.

He started crawling for it.

Didn't even get ten centimeters before a shiny leather shoe came down on his hand. Hard.


Rhys froze.

His eyes traveled up-sleek suit trousers, crisp jacket,perfectly calm rage-until he met Ashton's eyes.

That shut him right up.

Ashton looked down like Rhys was something stuck to his sole. "Yeah, call the cops. Let's tell them you stole an access card, broke in after midnight, and tried to assault and kidnap my wife. Definitely a 911 moment."

"I didn't... I wasn't kidnapping Mira, I just-"

"Shut the fuck up."

Ashton pressed harder on his hand.

Rhys let out a guttural squeal and bit his tongue.

Ashton pulled out his phone and made a call, his voice calm enough to scare me more than the shouting.

Two security guards showed up so fast I thought they'd been hiding behind the curtains.

One grabbed Rhys's left arm, the other his right.

"Mr. Laurent, this is on us. We'll have him taken to the station immediately. Won't happen again, sir."

When the hallway finally emptied and all the testosterone was gone, Ashton turned to me, caught my wrist again, and led me into his place.

"You're hurt," he said. "Let me see what I can do. Then we'll go to the hospital, just to be sure."

"I'm fine. Seriously." My voice didn't sound very convincing, mostly because I was too busy eyeing the minimalist murder-den he called a flat.

It looked exactly like the place across from my old apartment.

Black, white, grey.

Everything sharp-edged and spotless.
Not a single personal object.

Not even a coffee mug.

I sat on the sofa-if you could call it that; it felt like a furniture showroom display-and tried not to fidget.

Ashton crouched in front of me with a first aid kit,ignoring my objection.

My wrist throbbed, but what made me flinch wasn't the pain.

It was the memory of that look in his eyes earlier.

That ice-cold, controlled violence.

He paused, fingers just above my skin, and glanced up.

I guess he noticed.

"Are you upset I hit Rhys Granger?"1

His voice wasn't smug or apologetic.

Just...quiet.

Too quiet for a man who nearly beat someone into a coma five minutes ago.

If I hadn't grabbed his arm when I did, he probably would have finished the job.

I wasn't scared for Rhys; I was scared Ashton might actuallykill the guy.

When I didn't answer, he went back to dabbing antiseptic on my wrist.

I could tell from the slightly downturned shape of his mouth that he was stewing in it.
I'd been in love with Rhys for years.


Stupid,wasted years.

Ashton knew that.

I didn't blame him for assuming I still had a soft spot somewhere.


But I ddidn't.


"No,"I said.


He looked up again, searching my face as if he thought I might be lying.

"I wasn't upset for him. I was just scared you'd go full psycho and kill the guy. And then you'd go to prison."

His hands stilled.

Then he smiled. "So you were worried about me?"

"Yes. If you'd actually murdered him,we'd both be in handcuffs, with me as an accessory."

"I knew what I was doing. He wouldn't have died." He stood up. "So, you no longer feel anything for him?"

"Nope."

"Good. Then you probably won't feel anything either if |tell Dominic to make sure Rhys has a rough night in holding?"

He reached for his phone.
###Chapter 52Murdery Look
I slapped Ashton's hand before he could reach his phone.

"Okay, no. Let the cops handle it. You've already gone full Godfather once tonight."

I wasn't saying I didn't want Rhys to suffer.

I did.

I just wasn't willing to risk Ashton catching a charge for it.

When they dragged him off, Rhys already looked half -dead-blood all over his mouth, shirt soaked like something out of a bad crime doc.

"Rhys isn't worth going to prison for," I told Ashton, in case he misunderstood.


He exhaled heavily. "Fine. I'll leave the police to handle it. How's your wrist?"

I rotated my wrist and winced. Damn Rhys and his gym strength.

I didn't say anything, but Ashton saw the sweat beading at my temple.

"Right. Hospital. Now."

I grumbled, "It's not that bad. I'll live. It's late. Too much trouble to go to the hospital."

"I'll drive." His voice left zero room for debate.

I still didn't move, and he added, "What, are you waiting for me to carry you?"

That did it.

I sprang up like my arse was on fire. "Nope. I've got legs. Watch me use them."

He walked ahead, paused like he was considering taking my hand, then didn't.

Downstairs, he slid behind the wheel and drove us to a private hospital just minutes away.

I figured he probably played poker with the owner or something, because the second we pulled up,there were nurses and a doctor already waiting outside,clearly expecting us.

The X-ray showed no broken bones, just a nasty soft tissue injury.

Translation: it hurt like hell, but I wouldn't be needing a titanium wrist anytime soon.

While the doctor dabbed a minty-smelling ointment onto my wrist, Ashton stood behind me.

I couldn't see his face, but judging by the way the doctor was sweating through his white lab coat like the air con didn't exist, Ashton was probably looking murdery again.

He pulled out his phone and started walking away."Excuse me."
"'Are you calling your assistant?" I craned my neck to look at him.

He paused at the doorway. "Why do you ask?"

"If you're calling to arrange for Rhys to... you know."I glanced at the doctor.

"Are you telling me not to do it?" His voice hardened.

"No, I'm telling you... be discreet. Make sure you don't get caught."

He might have smiled. "Got it."

Once the doctor finished, we didn't hang around.

Just a quick wrap-up and we were back in the car.

I could feel the tension rolling off Ashton like heat from a busted radiator.


After a few blocks, he snapped out of it.

Glanced over at me like he'd only just remembered l was there.


"Rhys isn't going to let this go," he said. "He's not going to handle your marriage that well. You can't stay at Oakwood."

I stifled a yawn. "What? He's not a serial killer. He got arrested. He'll back off."

Ashton drummed his fingers on the steering wheel."You read the news? People kill their exes all the time these days. What if he's got some undiagnosed psycho streak? You wait until he sets your flat on fire or slashes your tires, and then what?" I shivered

The images of Rhys slapping me in his penthouse over Catherine's mug, of him dragging me down the hallway earlier tonight, slammed right back into my mind.


Maybe Ashton had a point.

"It's just... I literally just moved in. Paid three months upfront, can't get my deposit back. And finding another place is going to be a total nightmare."

We stopped at a red light.

Ashton turned to me, face smooth, voice dipped in just enough honey to raise suspicions. "You could move in with me."


I blinked. "Move in with you?"

I wasn't sure if he was kidding or just temporarily out of his mind.


This was a contract marriage.

No feelings, no funny business, and definitely no playing house.

The plan was to stay out of each other's way until the divorce.

"That's... probably not a great idea," | said slowly,trying to tell him it was a stupid idea without using those actual words.

He caught the look I shot him and let out a dry laugh "Relax. I'm not trying anything. It's just safer. And I'm not exactly emotionally invested in this relationship so there's zero chance I'll suddenly fall for you or anything like that."


Charming.

But honestly, the more indifferent he sounded, the more reassured I felt.

A man too cold to flirt was a man who wouldn't try to get into my bed.

Plus, wasn't he still saving himself for his precious lost love?


Living with him might just be glorified flat-sharing.

I was still hesitating when he added, "Besides,living together helps with my situation. With my grandfather,you know."

"Right. How's he doing?"

Green light.

He turned back to the road. "Much better. I showed him the marriage certificate. Worked like magic.He actually got out of bed that day."

"Glad to hear it."

"I told him you wanted to meet him. Grandpa said yes.He's feeling so much better now, he even wants to check out of the sanatorium and come home. If he sees me living there alone, wifeless..."

"Ah, I get it. Alright, I'll move in." Then I added, only half-joking, "Hope you don't snore."
He smiled I don't."

"Wait. I'm slammed at work this week. There's a project deadline I can't miss. I'll move in after that,once the dust settles, cool?"

He nodded. "That's fine."

As we pulled up outside Oakwood Apartments, he spoke again.

"My grandfather's turning eighty soon. There's going to be a big party. The entire Laurent family has to be there. You'll come with me."


I nodded. "Sure. I'll go with you. They know I'm your,um,wife,right?"

"Right." He glanced at me, smirking. "But I didn't tell them about our... arrangement. As far as they know,we're madly in love. Might have to act the part."

"Got it. I can act."
###Chapter 53Rhys's POV: Maximum...
Rhys was chained to a chair.

Hands cuffed. Ankles shackled. Designer shirt wrinkled beyond salvation.

The cops had rattled off a laundry list of charges: "Theft. Breaking and entering. Trespassing.Assault. Disturbing the peace. Kidnapping."

Rhys screeched, "You've got it all wrong! That's my fiancée! We just had a little lovers' spat, that's all!"

One of the officers didn't even look up from his notes.

"You stole a passcard to Oakwood Apartments. Broke into her flat. Dragged her out against her will. That's not a spat, Mr. Granger. That's criminal trespass. And according to our records, she's not your fiancée. You two broke off the engagement. You're strangers."

Rhys opened his mouth, closed it, then blinked. Hard.

Technically true. But still. Bit harsh.

"Look at me!" he whined. "I'm the one bleeding!Check out the bruises! I'm the real victim here. Arrest Ashton Laurent while you're at it-he's the one who smashed my face in!"

Another officer raised an eyebrow. "Given the circumstances, it looks a lot like self-defense."
Rhys groaned like his soul had been kicked in the nuts.

He sagged against the chair.

"Can I at least post bail? I need a hospital. If I stay here any longer, I'm gonna die of internal bleeding or whatever."


"You'll live. Sit tight." The officer shot him a flat look and left the room with the others.


Apparently, someone upstairs wanted to make an example of him.

Top-tier treatment, maximum punishment.

No way he was getting out any time soon.

***


Across town, Clive Granger found out what happened and went absolutely nuclear.

"Get him out," he barked at his assistant.


The assistant tried.


All day.

No Luck.


Clive knew someone was pulling strings behind the scenes.


He sighed, yanked on his coat, and decided to grovel in person.

Three days.

That's how long it took to call in favours, bend over backwards, and kiss arse from one end of Skyline to the other.
But finally, he got Rhys out


Rhys had barely stepped into the car before Clive slapped him so hard his vision pixelated.


"Useless piece of shit."

Rhys, already looking like he'd been thrown down an escalator, clutched his face and whimpered, "Dad,seriously, it wasn't my fault. Ashton set me up-"

"Shut your mouth! Drive to the hospital," he told the driver, then turned back to Rhys with a snarl. "What the hell were you thinking? You picked a fight with Ashton bloody Laurent?"

Rhys flailed weakly. "I didn't! He beat the crap out of me unprovoked!"

"You think I don't know what you were doing at Oakwood?" Clive shot him a glare that could've melted steel. "I told you how to spin the story.Direct the heat on Mirabelle. You can't even do that right!What do I have to do, write you a damn script?"

His tone dropped, serious now. "Leave Mirabelle alone for now. I'm booking you into a hospital. Stay there and heal up. And for the love of God, don't cause another scandal."


"Yeah,yeah...got it..."

Clive hired a full-time nurse to watch over Rhys and very intentionally barred Louisa and Willow from visiting.

Rhys lay in the hospital bed, staring at the ceiling.
Catherine had been calling him nonstop, leaving increasingly frantic voice messages.
He'd replied with a curt "I'm fine," then shut off his phone before she could ask him again if he preferred èze or Nice.

As if he could be going anywhere anytime soon.
It hurt for him to sit up, to wince, even to spit.

The more he thought about it, the more his blood boiled.


He hadn't even thrown a punch, and now his whole body felt like it had been run over by a garbage truck.
Meanwhile,Mirabelle got to waltz around town looking smug,probably/ shopping for her wedding dress.
She was the reason Rhys was bleeding, yet somehow,she came out of it squeaky clean.
Rage crawled under his skin like ants.

Screw what his father said.

He wasn't going down without a fight.
Rhys yanked out his phone and opened the group chat with his closest friends, his inner circle.

Rhys: [Mirabelle ran off with someone else. Wedding's off.I'm done.]

Message sent.

Boom. It was like setting off a grenade in a crowded room.

The group chat lit up.
Montgomery Hayes was the first to bite.

Monty Hayes: [Wait, what the hell? Mirabelle cheated on you?]

More came flooding in:

[She used to follow you around everywhere. What'd you do to piss her off this time?]

[Didn't we bet she'd come crawling back in,like,three days? And now she's run off with someone else?]

[Is this a joke? @Rhys, did you get blackout drunk again?]

Rhys stabbed his thumbs at the screen.

Rhys: [I'M NOT drunk. Mirabelle screwed me over.She's been sneaking around with some random guy.The engagement's off. So's the wedding. You can burn the invites.]


There was no way he was dropping Ashton's name.

Hell no. That was suicide by group chat.

So he kept it vague.

The bait worked.

[Damn. So much for her good girl act. Mira's got game.]

[Always thought she looked too innocent. Those are the sneakiest ones.]

[Fact:women always cheat.]

[Sorry, bro. You'll find somebody better.]

[Yeah, like Cathy. She's back in town, isn't she?]
[Forget Mira, bro,come out tonight, let's hit the new strip club on 8th.]





Rhys watched the accusations stack up.

Every insult, every dig, every emoji-flavored roast-it was healing.

He recorded a voice note, deliberately raspy, half-sniffle,half-Oscar reel.

Rhys: [She lied to me, guys... properly wrecked me.l gave her everything, and she just... yeah. GuesS I wasn't enough. I'm not in the mood to hang out.Just leave me alone for a while, okay?]

And Send.
###Chapter 54Viral Group Chat
Rhys disappeared from my life.
I didn't care if he was in jail or in a hospital, as long as he wasn't six feet under.

It was a fine Friday, and I was at the Nyx Collective studio admiring the necklace I'd just designed.
I'd used my employee perks to get it custom-made-my design,my materials, my signature, my everything.
There was literally only one of these in the world.

And in two days, it was going to be Yvaine's birthday present.

I had barely had time to breathe in its perfection when my phone lit up with Yvaine's name.
Shit. Had she somehow found out?

Surprise ruined.

I picked up, bracing myself.

Instead,I got:

"That dickstain! Next time I see him, I'm stapling his lying mouth shut. The balls on him, spewing bullshit like he's got a diploma in defamation. Did he eat shame for breakfast or was he just born this scummy?"
"Whoa, slow down, what happened?" I asked.
"Check your phone. I just sent you some screenshots.That sewer rat's mouthing off again."

I opened the images.

"Are you kidding me?" I muttered. "Rhys actually said that?"


"Said it, sent it, and broadcast it," Yvaine spat "Someone in his boys-only group chat leaked it. It's already in, like, fifteen chats. I saw it in a spin class group I don't even remember joining."

"Of course it's going viral," I mumbled. "Everybody loves a good scandal."

"I got myself added to his little dick-swinging group chat. Don't ask how. I tagged him in every message and asked him to retract his damn lies."


"I'm guessing he didn't comply."

"He went silent, that weasel. Then someone kicked me out of the group, probably after Rhys went crying to the mod like the spineless little coward he is."


I nodded. "You got the coward part right."

"He's not just a coward. He's a half-baked twatwaffle with a megaphone for a mouth."

"Twatwaffle?" I laughed. "You, uh, seem to have picked up some new vocabulary."

"I've got loads more. That sad little fart-stain, walking around like his mouth's directly wired to his arse.Honestly, if he had half a brain cell, it'd die of loneliness. Calling him useless is an insult to actual useless things. He and Catherine should get married already-perfect match, right down to the trash they spew. Cupid's algorithm finally doing its job."

I pulled the phone away from my ear.

Her volume was breaking the sound barrier and rattling my skull.

"Breathe, Yvie," I told her. "He's got nothing, so he's making stuff up to shift the blame. Don't give him the satisfaction of a reaction."


Yvaine huffed, but her voice dropped a decibel or two."He even sent voice messages, like he's the one being wronged. Can you believe the nerve? I could scream.I am screaming."

Anyone would have been furious getting publicly dragged through the mud.

But I had already slipped into strategy mode. "Cool your jets. Don't go back in the ring swinging just yet."

"Nope. No chance in hell. I need to get back in that group. I'm not done with him."

I could practically hear her rolling up her sleeves.War mode: activated.

"No, don't, Yvie," I said quickly. "Let them keep yapping. The worse it gets, the better."

"Are you fucking serious right now?" she yelled. "It's getting worse by the second. I swear, I'm two clicks away from hiring some hacker to nuke their phones from orbit. You haven't seen everything I have. What I sent you was just the tip of the flaming shitberg.Rhys's idiot friends are talking so much shit, it'd need a bleep every other word if I read it out loud."

"That's okay. Let them keep talking."

"You serious right now? Is this Mirabelle I'm talking to?Or has some peace-loving alien taken over your body?"

"Just hear me out. Do you know anyone else in the group? Someone who can keep feeding us screenshots?"

"Hell yes. One of my friends is in there. Rhys has no idea we're connected. He's my little undercover spy."

"Perfect. Tell him to keep grabbing everything. I want every single lie Rhys spits about me on record."

There was a pause. Then Yvaine caught on. "You're going legal, aren't you?"

"Damn right I am."

I hung up, messaged Savannah to cover for me,and left work early.

I didn't go home. I took a left instead, down the street behind Nyx Collective.

I remembered seeing a law firm near here

Small place, nothing flashy.

But it'd do.


If Rhys wanted to run his mouth, he could do it in court.


The receptionist looked up from her computer with a  tired smile. "Hello. Do you have an appointment?""No."

"We're closing soon, and all the lawyers are in meetings. Maybe come back on Monday?"

I started to turn, already planning to hit another firm or maybe just call someone online.

Then a voice called out behind me: "Mirabelle?Mirabelle Vance?"


I stopped, glanced back, and saw a guy in a perfectly ironed suit stepping out of the lift with a black briefcase.


Lawyer vibes were written all over him.

I stared at his face for a beat before it clicked."Finnigan Carter, right?"

"Guilty as charged." He walked over, grinning. "What are you doing here?"

"I could ask you the same. Are you working here?"

"Sure am."


"Right. You did pre-law in college, I remember now."

"Damn, it's been ages," he said. "You here for legal advice?"


"Yeah." I nodded, but glanced at the clock. "But you guys are closing, right?"

He shrugged. "Nah, come on. I'll take you. I just wrapped up my last case anyway. Was gonna sneak out early. Guess fate had other plans."
"Are you sure? I don't want to mess up your plans."
###Chapter 55 Out for Blood
Finn pulled a face. "Please don't remind me that, as a fully grown, gainfully employed adult, my big Friday night plan is sharing reheated lasagna with my judgmental cat." He flashed another grin at me."You're at least better company. And less judgmental,I hope."

I laughed. "Alright then. Thanks. You're a lifesaver."

We got in the lift.

Seeing a familiar face here felt like a little cosmic pat on the back.

Once we were in a conference room, I handed him my phone. "Someone's been spreading lies about me. Can I sue?"


Finn scrolled through the screenshots, his jaw tightening. "Jesus, these people are savage. Yeah, if all this is made up, it's definitely defamation. You can go civil, or even criminal if you want to push it. That kind of shit's not protected."

"I'm sure it's all lies. Every word."

Finn scrolled again, slower this time, then frowned."Wait. The guy who sent all this... Rhys Granger?"

I nodded.
 His head snapped up. "The same Rhys who...?"

Another nod from me. This time with bonus shame

Back then, I hadn't exactly been broadcasting my crush on Rhys, but let's be real, people knew.

Hard not to, especially after Catherine uploaded scans of my diary to the school intranet like it was breaking news.


Boom.Instant humiliation.

Everyone suddenly knew I had a tragic, textbook-case crush on my sister's boyfriend.

College life could be brutal. Especially when you were the headline.

Still, I had friends. Including Finn.

We were in the same club, and he'd been nice to me from day one.

He never pried.

When everyone else wanted the tea, Finn just quietly made sure I got included in all the club activities and listened whenever I wanted to vent.

If he hadn't graduated early and bolted off to law school,we probably would've stayed close.

Still, all these years later, seeing someone from my "hopelessly simping for Rhys" era made me want to crawl into the nearest bin.


Reluctantly,I elaborated."We got engaged, then we,ah, broke up. He didn't take it well. So now he's playing petty, spreading stuff to make me look bad But he's the one who cheated, honest."7


Finn blinked.

I saw it-somewhere behind the professional poker face, a little crack.


"Send me everything," he said, voice low. "I'll handle the lawsuit."


"The comments are ongoing and getting worse. His fanboys are still going off on me. I'll send you more later."

"The worse, the better. If he keeps this up, the judge'll be begging to slap him with charges."

"Cool. Appreciate it."

Yvaine was basically living on her phone at this point,refreshing like it was a second job.

Every time Rhys dropped a message in their group chat, one of her friends screenshotted it, sent it to her, and she passed it to me.

I forwarded the mess to Finn.


But lawsuits took time.


Yvaine didn't have that kind of patience.


Her birthday was coming up, and she was out for blood.


"I invited Rhys and Catherine to my birthday party,"she called and told me."Watch how I ruin their day for you."
I tried to be reasonable. "Don't let those clowns mess up your birthday. It's not worth it."

"Making them squirm is the only thing that'll make it worth it."


I yielded.

Sunday afternoon, I turned up at her house with a tiny,ribbon-wrapped box.

"Custom-made," I said, handing it over. "Only one in the world."


"Shut up. I love it!" Yvaine was already clasping the necklace around her neck, twirling in front of the mirror, snapping selfies.

Then Cassian Langford walked in.

Yvaine blinked."Wait, what are you doing here?"

He lifted a sleek black gift bag like it was a peace offering. "Your brother's stuck overseas. Sent me to play the charming stand-in."

"Ooh,what did he get me?"

He held up two bags. "One's from Emmett. The other's from me. Guess which is better."


She pointed to her neck. "Neither. This is the best."

Cassian looked at me and nodded.


While Yvaine greeted the incoming guests, Cassian stood next to me.


Several times, he opened his mouth like he wanted to say something, but in the end decided not to.
I was tempted to ask him to spit it out when the party proper started.

The place was packed.

Yvaine had enough energy to power the city grid, and half of Skyline's social climbers were here kissing her arse.


The gift pile had mutated into a three-metre-high shrine in the corner.

I was halfway through my mocktail when Rhys finally showed up.

And of course, he brought her.

Rhys glanced around the room and stared straight at me.


He knew I'd be here.


Showing up with Catherine was part of his whole pathetic power play.

Message received, loud and clear: You can move on,babe,so can l.

Childish. Predictable. And not even original.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd at the sight of those two, especially Rhys.

He still hadn't healed completely from the beating Ashton gave him last week.

He'd probably snuck out of the hospital with a bruised jaw and stitched-up lip just so he could try and make me jealous.
 I squared my shoulders.


Yvaine touched my arm. "Let me have a go first.Come on. I've got a whole thing planned. Even did a rehearsal."

Her smile was feral.

I gave her the floor.

She elbowed one of her friends and flicked her chin in their direction.


That was the signal.

Near the door, I caught someone disguised as a party photographer filming Rhys and Catherine.

Probably another part of Yvaine's plan.

I eased closer fora look.


The camera caught them at just the right moment.

One frame even looked like a kiss-pure illusion,but it didn't matter.


A second later, my phone vibrated.
###Chapter 56 Fists Speak Louder
Yvaine had just dumped the pics into half a dozen group chats without a single caption.

Then her gang kicked off their performance like it was rehearsed.


Voices up, filters off.

"Is that Catherine Vance?"

"Sure is. Lucky girl. Had Rhys Granger wrapped around her finger back in the day, dumped him, disappeared overseas for years, and still crawled back into his bed like nothing happened."

"Deadass.Word is, he's paying her to be his secretary now. Like, girl didn't even study anything close to that."

"Please, I heard she majored in interior design or something, nothing to do with admin."


"Nepotism much?"

"Bet they do role-play in the office. 'Mr. Granger,I need a raise...' Bitch, please, we know how you're earning that bonus."

They didn't even bother whispering.

If anything, they leaned in louder, like they were auditioning for Mean Girls:The Grown-Up Edition.
Rhys and Catherine were maybe two feet away, and their faces said everything


Pale, angry,cornered.

Catherine blinked quickly, like she was fighting back tears. "That's not true," she mumbled, her voice trembling. "Rhys and I aren't like that. We're just colleagues. We only came in together because we bumped into each other at the door."


Cute excuse.


Ten out of ten for effort, but no one was buying it.

Especially not with Rhys standing there like a mute statue.


They hadn't gone public with their relationship,obviously, though I no longer cared to analyze why.

Maybe sneaking around was part of the fun for them

Yvaine drifted past with a wine glass and an Oscar-worthy smirk, then oops-red wine all over Catherine's dress.


Hand slipped.Whoopsie.

"Oh dear,my bad. Didn't see you there," she said, not even pretending to sound sorry. "But since you egged Serenna into throwing wine on me at the Laurents ' party, I guess we're even now."

Catherine clenched her jaw and hissed, "Fine. We're even."


She tried to move away, but Yvaine wouldn't let her."I'll pay you for the dress. How much is it?"
Catherine tossed her hair over her shoulder. "Five grand."


Yvaine nodded. "Okay, five grand. Then you owe me fifteen grand."

Catherine stared. "What the hell are you talking about?"

"The dress I wore to the Laurent party. It was tailored -twenty thousand dollars. Yours is off-the-rack,right?Anyway,wanna do card or cash?"

Catherine's eyes almost popped out of her head."Twenty grand? Are you freaking kidding me?"

Yvaine scoffed. "Didn't your mommy and daddy raise you like a spoiled little princess? What, they never bought you a twenty-thousand-dollar dress? Pathetic.Fine, I'll cut you a discount. Just give me ten. It'll be my good deed for the day."

Catherine's face went from cherry red to sheet white.

Her fists clenched so tightly I half-expected to see blood. "This is extortion."

"I've got receipts," Yvaine said. "Want screenshots or printed copies?"

Catherine whipped her head to Rhys. "Say something,Rhys!"

He frowned.


Yvaine raised a hand, not even looking at him. "This is between the girls, Rhys. Sit down and shut up."

He did.
Catherine's lips started to tremble.


She scanned the room like she was hunting for backup

Found me instead.


Her eyes narrowed. "You put her up to this, didn't you?"

I shrugged.

Yvaine snapped her fingers in Catherine's face."Uh-uh.Eyes over here. We're not done. Fork it over."

Catherine looked around again, desperate now.

But tonight's crowd was mostly women, not the type to fall for her good looks and damsel energy.

The few guys around had the good sense to keep their mouths shut.


Nobody wanted trouble with Yvaine Carlisle,not when she had a revenge streak a mile long.

Catherine turned back to Rhys-her last hope

Still useless.


Rhys had that glazed, stunned look on his face, like it had just hit him that he wasn't the star of the party anymore.

Catherine bit her lip. "This is just revenge! You poured wine on me on purpose! You're only doing this because of Mirabelle, because she's too much of a coward to stand up for herself. Well, guess what?That's why Rhys dumped her. No spine!"

Crack.


The slap echoed like a gunshot.
A perfect,open-palmed serve right across her face.

Yvaine flicked her wrist like she'd just scored match point.

"Everyone knows who the cheater is here. Say one more word about Mirabelle and I'll knock your teeth out for free."

Rhys shot to his feet,pulling Catherine to his side.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" he snarled at Yvaine.


She turned to the crowd and raised her voice like we were in court."Oh,now he's protecting her? Says they're just colleagues, but look, he's fixing her soggy dress, escorting her to parties like they're an old married couple. Anyone here do that with your 'colleagues'?"

Everyone behind her chimed in like	a choir: "Absolutely not!"

"We're leaving," Rhys growled, grabbing Catherine's wrist.


Yvaine blocked their way before they could even turn.

"Going somewhere? On my birthday? After showing up with one gift between the two of you and turning my party into a Jerry Springer episode?"

Rhys looked ready to explode. "Move!"

Yvaine stood her ground.

He shoved her.
Her heels were skyscraper-tall, and she wobbled like a baby giraffe.

I caught her before she faceplanted, then stepped right up to Rhys.

And slapped him.

Twice.


It felt fantastic, not going to lie.

My hand stung like hell, but watching his smug face whip sideways was worth every nerve ending.

I thought about the trash he'd posted in that group chat this week. The dirty jokes, the smug texts, the smugger selfies.

So I slapped him again.

Twice more.


Four clean hits before anyone even realized what was happening.

His face was already puffy from what Ashton did to him, and now it looked like he'd lost a fight witha frying pan.

If he'd had any jawline left, it was gone now.

And, weirdly, I kind of understood it.

That sharp, visceral satisfaction in being able to physically overwhelm someone who deserved it-it made a sort of primitive sense.


Not that I was endorsing violence or anything, but sometimes, words just didn't cut it.
Sometimes fists spoke louder.

I shook out my hand and snapped, "Apologize to Yvaine."
###Chapter 57Evidence On a Silver Plat...
Rhys blinked.

He looked mildly concussed, and maybe he was.

Then he snarled, "Why the hell should I? She poured the damn drink on purpose, she hit Catherine,you hit me. Now you want us to say sorry?"

He looked around as if searching for support

Too bad no one was on his side.

Every guest was shouting for him to apologize.

Some even pulled out their phones-classic Skyline behavior. Justice via Instagram Live.


Rhys glared at me.

His whole body was shaking.

If we'd been alone, I bet he would have swung back.

But we weren't.


He might be stupid, but there was no way he was hitting a woman on camera.

So he used his mouth instead.


"Mirabelle, who the hell do you think you are? You cheated, you ran off with some other guy, you broke off the engagement. If anyone should apologize, it's you."
 I smiled. "You're saying I cheated?"

Rhys went red. Loud red. "Yes! You cheated!"

"You're saying I ran off with some random guy?"

"Damn right! You're heartless. You slept around while we were still together, then dumped me like trash.You're a disgrace."

He kept yelling, his voice cracking, arms flailing.

I waited for him to run out of steam.

Then I asked, "So... you got proof of any of that?"

That gave him pause. "No... but it's true!"

"Brilliant," I said,giving my phone a little twirl between my fingers. "Because I recorded all that. Every word."

His jaw dropped. "You recorded it? What for?" He sneered. "Gonna cry over it at home?"

I shook my head. "You really are an idiot."

Then I turned to the crowd behind us and raised my voice just enough. "You all heard that, right? Rhys Granger slandering me at a public event. I've already got a lawyer. Consider yourselves witnesses."

Rhys started sweating. "What the hell are you talking about?"


I spun back. "I was worried I didn't have enough to go on. But then you showed up and handed me evidence on a silver platter. Thanks for that, by the way."

He stood there gaping.

Took him a full ten seconds to reboot.
"You're suing me?" he spluttered. "You seriously think you've got the guts?"

Catherine was whispering under her breath like l couldn't hear her. "Rhys isn't totally wrong. You were messing around with some random guy, weren't you?"

I pointed my phone in her direction. "I recorded that,too. And I'll be adding your name to the lawsuit. You and Rhys can split the court fees."

Her mouth snapped shut. Fast.

Rhys must've finally noticed the way everyone was staring at him-like he'd just farted in church-because he grabbed Catherine's arm and turned to bolt for the door.


"Oi!" Yvaine shouted after them. "You still owe me for my bloody dress!"

They kept walking like their lives depended on getting the hell out of there.


They didn't get far.

Cassian Langford stepped in from the side,casual as anything, and blocked their path.

I nudged Yvaine. "Is he part of your plan, too?"

She nudged back. "No. Didn't even know he was coming today."

"Mr. Granger," he said,"we're not quite done here.You've yet to apologize, and the dress still hasn't been paid for. Surely that's not the way the Grangers handle things?"
Cassian was smiling, but there was no warmth in it.

His familiar predator-like expression reminded me of Ashton, and I suddenly understood what Cassian was doing here.

Rhys froze.

He might have been dumb enough to piss off Yvaine but even he wasn't suicidal enough to cross a Langford.

Rhys's dad, Clive, basically bowed when he saw Cassian at corporate events.

"Mr.Langford, you saw what happened," Rhys tried. "It was Yvaine and Mirabelle who got physical. Catherine and I were the victims."


He actually sounded like he believed that.

"Then call the police," Cassian said. "I don't care about the scuffle. That's for the court to sort out. But you're not denying that your girlfriend here"-he tilted his chin at Catherine-"ruined Yvaine's dress?"

"She's not my girlfriend," Rhys said in a hurry.

Catherine looked like she wanted to say something but Rhys shut her down.

"Fine. Will you at least acknowledge that she's your date? You did show up to the party with her, didn't you?"Cassian glanced at the photographer Yvaine had hired."If you need help jogging your memory..."

"No need! Yeah, she's my... date," Rhys admitted reluctantly.
"Good. I imagine fifteen grand isn't beyond the Grangel family budget?"

Rhys could definitely afford it.

But handing over the money would mean admitting Yvaine and I had won.


"It was an accident," he tried vainly.d Yvaine ruined Cathy's dress, too. Maybe we should just call it even?"


"I hear Granger Development Group is bidding on that Redwood Creek redevelopment project? I happen to have friends who are sitting on the City Planning Commission..." Cassian didn't need to finish the sentence.


Rhys got the hint fast.

If he fumbled that deal over a dress, his dad would actually murder him with a caviar spoon.

"We'll pay," Rhys blurted. "Of course we'll pay. It's all a misunderstanding, just a stupid dress..."

He shot Catherine a look that basically screamed: pay up or I will drown you in the punch bowl.

She gave him that wide-eyed, damsel-in-distress stare, hoping he'd swoop in and save her wallet.

He didn't blink. "Catherine, transfer the money. Now.""But, Rhys!" she whined.

Rhys didn't budge.

Eventually, with half the room watching, Catherine pulled out her phone and tapped through the transfer Yvaine's phone buzzed.

She checked the screen, saw the money had landed.and gave a tiny nod. "You're free to go."

Rhys and Catherine slithered out of the house.

Yvaine looked disappointed. "I've got more stuff planned."



I smiled. "Maybe next time."

She looped her arm through mine. "Come on, now it's time for the real party. Also, where's your boyfriend?I did send Ashton an invite, didn't l?"

"He's not my boyfriend," I said automatically.

Yvaine grinned. "Sure, sure. Because he's obviously much more than that now."


She leaned in,eyes gleaming.

I knew that look.

I'd seen it too many times not to brace for impact.

I tried to squirm away, but she was fast.

"So? How's married life treating you? You climb that man yet or what? What position did you use? Were you on top or-"

I bolted for the bathroom before her questions got even more X-rated.
 ###Chapter 58Rhys's POV: Two Hundre...
After leaving Yvaine's party, Rhys and Catherine didn't say a word.

Neither of them had the energy to pretend.

The whole night had been one long marathon of humiliation, and they were both too pissed to bother hiding it.

At the curb, Rhys pulled his coat tighter and grunted,"Wait here. I'll get the car."

"Fine," Catherine muttered.


He'd barely turned the corner when some guy jumped out of the flowerbed, nearly scaring Catherine to death.


"Cathy!" the boy hissed.

He couldn't have been older than twenty, and he was wearing a rent-a-cop uniform two sizes too big.

She recognized him instantly and dragged him right back behind the bushes by the scruff of his sleeve.

Her nails dug into his arm.

"Are you insane?" she hissed, wild-eyed. "I told you not to contact me! How the hell did you even find me?If anyone sees us-Jesus, I'm screwed."
He shook her off and flicked a half-smoked cigarette onto the ground.

"Couldn't reach you on the phone," he said with a shrug. "Had to come find you myself."

Her mouth twitched like she wanted to slap him,or scream-or both. "What do you want?"

"Money.What else?"

She froze.


"Dad's getting worse. Docs say surgery's non-negotiable. It's gonna cost two hundred grand. You're going to give it to me."

Catherine's face changed quickly.

She'd just been bled by Yvaine for fifteen grand

Another two hundred K?


She didn't have that kind of cash lying around in her purse.

She eyed him, arms crossed, one brow lifted high enough to scrape the moon. "Is he really that sick? Or did you gamble yourself into another hole?"

The boy's jaw twitched.

He hesitated for just a second. "Of course it's Dad.You think I'd lie to you?"

She didn't even bother to hide the disbelief in her voice. "You've gambled it away again, haven't you?|told you, I can't keep bailing you out. If you're not going to quit, then I'm done. I'm not your bloody ATM."
The boy snatched out his phone and shoved it in her face. "Look! The doctor messaged me!"

She didn't even look at the screen.


Could have been porn or pizza coupons for all she cared. "I don't have the money."

"Bullshit!" he shouted. "You're Rhys Granger's side piece. One of his gifts to you probably costs more than my old man's surgery!"

That hit home.


Catherine's face drained to a pale, waxy white. "I'm not-"


"We blew so much cash on you back then," the boy spat. "And now when it's me and my dad needing help,you're suddenly broke?"

Her lips parted,shaky, like she'd just been slapped. "I'm not... not a side piece. Rhys and I, we're together.Properly."

"Even better," he scoffed. "Thought I heard he ditched Mirabelle Vance. So what's the holdup? Why hasn't he put a ring on it?"

Catherine took a sharp breath.

Then another.

Like she was trying to bottle her panic and save it for later.

"I'll send you the money. In a few days. Just go. If anyone sees you, it's over for me."
 The boy didn't budge. "A few days? How many's a few?""Ten."

"That's too long!"

"Fine! Three. Now go!"

"Fine. But if that money's not in my account by day three... you know what I can do." He bolted before she could answer, disappearing down the street.

The second he vanished, Rhys's car rolled up to the curb.

Catherine clenched her fists so hard her nails dug little half-moons into her palm.

She slid into the passenger seat like nothing had happened.

Rhys glanced at her lazily as he pulled back into traffic."Saw you chatting with someone just now. Friend of yours?"

Catherine forced a breath, smiling like she hadn't just been blackmailed behind a hedge.

The music in the car helped drown out the thudding in her chest.

"No. Just someone asking for directions."

"Right," Rhys muttered, eyes on the road. "Figured. No way you'd hang out with someone wearing knock-off trainers."

Catherine bit down on her lip, nodded, and forced a laugh. "Yeah. Exactly."
To Rhys, Catherine was still the same spoiled little debutante, born to designer shoes and Sunday brunches.


Even after moving abroad, she'd been living the rich-girl dream, at least according to her Instagram updates.

The idea that she might know someone outside his curated little world was simply unthinkable.

They drove in silence for a while.

She stared out the window like it might show her a way out.

Finally,she spoke.

Sweet. Careful. Like someone testing the temperature of bathwater before diving in.

"Rhys... I saw this bag the other day. Really pretty. But I'm short on cash."


"How much?"


"Two hundred thousand."


That got his attention.

His head snapped to her, brows pulling into that tight little V he always wore when his mood soured.

Which, lately, was all the damn time.

"I already paid for your flights and hotels in France.What the hell do you need two hundred grand for?"

Catherine pouted. "But it's the last one, Rhys. Limited edition. They're not making it again. I've literally never  wanted anything more in my life."

Rhys didn't budge. "You don't need a handbag that costs two hundred grand."

Catherine leaned in.

Close enough that her hair brushed his arm,her breath on his cheek.


She murmured something low against his ear.

His mouth twitched. "W/ith your mouth?"

"And anywhere else you like. I'll wear the red corset."

He exhaled hard through his nose. "Yeah, alright."
###Chapter 59 Left out of the Loop
The second Rhys and Catherine vanished from Yvaine's party, the vibe bounced right back as if they'd never existed.


Yvaine was in her element, gliding from group to group like she'd grown up on a champagne tray.

She laughed too loud,hugged too many people, and somehow remembered everyone's dog's name.

It was her birthday, after all, so every time someone raised a glass, she drank like it was her duty.

I kept an eye on her between sips of my own watered -down cocktail.

Meanwhile,Cassian had parked himself beside me with a drink he didn't touch and a smile that was trying a little too hard.


He asked where I was from, what I did, whether l preferred Cosmopolitan or Old Fashioned-but he wasn't fooling anyone.

He knew, and he was dying to get the story behind why his good friend Ashton had suddenly decided to wife me up.


I played dumb, smiled sweetly, and answered every question without telling him a thing.
 When the party finally broke up. Yvaine found me.clung to my arm, and slurred, "I'm taking you home,babe. Come on. My car's... somewhere."

I rolled my eyes. "Yvie, I've had, like, three drinks.You can barely spell your own name right now."

Cassian peeled her off me. "I'll take you."

"Thanks, but don't worry about me. It's late and I'm not even on your way. I'll just grab a cab."

He hesitated. "Ash asked me to-"

"It's fine." I smiled. "I can take care of myself."


"You sure?"


"Positive. Good night, Yvie. Goodbye, Cassian."

I ordered a ride and headed back to Oakwood.

There used to be just two guards at the front gate.

Now there were five.

All burly, all alert, and all apparently recognized me by the head tilt they gave me as I passed.

Ashton had hired them after Rhys barged his way into the building last time.

Even though he was off on some last-minute business trip, he still made sure Cassian was keeping an eye on me at Yvaine's party.

He still had security beefed up at the building.

He never said a word about it, though. Just did it.

I hadn't drunk much, but by the time I got upstairs, the night hit me all at once.
 I stripped, showered, and flopped straight into bed without setting an alarm.

It was the weekend, after all.

I woke up to the sun roasting my face and my phone shrieking like a banshee.

Squinting, I fumbled around until I saw the name on the screen: Savannah Lane.


That sobered me up real fast.

Savannah never called me on weekends, not unless the building was on fire.

I swiped to answer."Savannah-"

"Mirabelle Vance! Where the hell are you?! I've called you three times. Don't tell me you're still in bed."

I glanced at the screen.


Two missed calls.


Shit.


"I mean...technically, yes. It's Saturday, so-"

"It's bloody Sunday!" she shrieked. "And in case your beauty sleep turned you into a goldfish, today is the day Eliza Black comes in to review the new jewelry pitch. You're at home? In your pajamas?!"

I shot up so fast I nearly dislocated something.

My phone screen helpfully reminded me: Sunday,10:42 a.m.


"I thought she was coming tomorrow, Monday-"

"I told you they changed the date. Last week. She's a global A-lister. Mira, and she-"

"More like B-lister," I mumbled.

"Shut up and listen! She cleared her schedule for Nyx Collective. She's here right now! You think she's going to wait around because you needed an extra lie-in?"

"No-I mean yes-l didn't get the update, I swear-"

"Save it." Her voice cut clean through my panic. "You want this project? You want your name on Eliza Black's red carpet looks? Then get your arse in here now. You're the best designer I've got. Don't blow this because you slept through a calendar change."

Click. She was gone.

I sat there, stunned for about five seconds, then scrambled out of bed, tripped into my slippers, and raced to the bathroom.


I hadn't seen any reschedule.

No email. No message. Nothing.

I'd sworn it was set for Monday.

Someone had screwed with me.

No way that update just magically skipped me.

Someone-cough Violet bloody Lin cough-had made sure I was left out of the loop.

But I didn't have time to sit around cursing her name and plotting her slow demise.

I'd pulled three all-nighters for that pitch.

Blood,sweat,and not nearly enough coffee went into that deck

Missing this meeting wasn't an option, not unless l wanted to kiss my shot at real industry cred goodbye.

By the time I barreled intoNyx Collective, it was past eleven.

Every designer had already shown their proposals.

Eliza Black's agent was halfway out the door,throwing Savannah a look that said "wrap it up or I'm walking."

Savannah had begged. Negotiated. Maybe offered up her soul.

Eventually, the agent had relented.

Ten minutes, no more.

I made it into the conference room on the final minute of that countdown.

I was a mess-sweaty from sprinting up five flights of stairs, hair wild like l'd just crawled out of a wind tunnel.

My blouse was sticking to my back, and I couldn't feel my left leg.

Eliza Black was perched at the front of the room in head-to-toe black, a designer mask covering most of her face.

Just her eyes were showing, sharp and watchful.

She looked exactly like she did on screen.

Only now, she wasn't smiling.

Gone was the grinning, bubbly pop princess.
This Eliza was ice.


Still,silent, judgmental.

And probably five seconds away from standing up and walking the hell out.
 ###Chapter 60 Two -faced Intern
I didn't bother with a sob story.

Just apologized for the delay and launched straight into my pitch.

I tugged my shirt into place and let the projector warm up, using those precious seconds to steady my breathing and slow my heart down from hummingbird -on-espresso mode.

They weren't looking at sketches yet, just raw concept.




I called mine BloomState.


Every piece was based on the fleeting moments flowers go through.

I started with the bud: tiny stud earrings, twisted into a barely-there spiral.

Then came the open heart necklace. A stylized bloom,fully open.

The Seed Pod Ring was the show-off. All structure and sharp angles, but with a kind of quiet rhythm to it.

And finally, the Dewdrop Collar. Fine chain, light-catching stones that looked like drops of morning dew.

I'd studied Eliza Black's whole catalog, stalked every fan theory thread, and read every fashion blogger's take.


She was known for being playful, but this was going to rebrand her as a bloody icon.

Halfway through, I found my rhythm.

My voice evened out, and my words stopped tripping over each other.

Eliza didn't react.


Not a blink, not a twitch, not even a polite nod.

She just sat there, still masked, legs crossed, arms folded, the human equivalent of a locked phone screen.


But at least she didn't look like she was about to bolt anymore.

As soon as I wrapped, her agent stood up. "She has a shoot. We're already running late. We'll let you know our decision soon."


And they were gone.

The second the door shut, Savannah rounded on me.

"Do you know how many people were sat here twiddling their thumbs waiting on you? If I hadn't begged and bartered like a bloody hostage negotiator,they'd have walked!"

I didn't argue.

I didn't need to.

Savannah had a mouth like a guillotine but a heart made of marshmallow.
 She wasn't mad at me.

She was mad at how close I'd come to flushing the opportunity of the year down the toilet.
I swigged an entire bottle of mineral water before l could speak.
"Savannah, babe, I swear I didn't know they changed the time. If I'd known the meeting was today, do you seriously think I'd have been at home passed out in my pajamas?"

She squinted at me.

I could see the gears grinding behind her smoky eyeliner.
She knew me.

I wasn't the kind to ditch work without a damn good reason.

I'd done late nights voluntarily, just to use the studio's centrifugal caster when no one else was hogging it.
Freelance or not, I'd earned my stripes.

Then Savannah turned her head slowly and aimed that laser glare at Chloe Shaw.
"Did you not tell Mira the meeting time was moved?"

The admin assistant looked like a startled fawn caught in headlights.
Chloe was fresh off probation, officially signed on last month, and still walked like she hadn't broken in her heels yet.

"I did! I told her!" Her voice took on a whiny, panicky edge. "I told everyone, like, two days ago. I swear l told Mira. I said it to her in person. There's no way she didn't know."

I snapped my laptop shut. "Funny. I haven't seen you in days. What time exactly did you tell me? Give me the full deets, timestamp and all."

Her face twitched. "It was right before the end of the day, around 4:30? Savannah told me it was super important everyone knew, so I told everyone one by one.Just to be safe.Face-to-face."


A voice piped up behind me. "Yeah,Chloe was really clear about it. Kept reminding me like ten times. You don't get interns this conscientious anymore."

I glanced sideways.

The guy piping up had Violet Lin's scent all over him-same fake charm, same smug loyalty.

Her little fan club had clearly rehearsed their lines ahead of time.


My eyes chilled.

I turned to Chloe Shaw and asked, slowly, like I was offering her a last chance to stop digging her grave,"If you really came to tell me, in the office, on Friday afternoon, then someone must've seen you. Who can back you up?"

"I, ah, I went to you when the office was empty. No one was around. So... no, no one saw me."
I laughed.

Not a haha-funny laugh.

More of a you've-got-to-be-fucking-kidding-me laugh.




"Right.Four-thirty,just before clock-out? You expect me to believe the entire floor was a ghost town?"

There wasn't a single day when that place was quiet at 4:30.

People were usually hovering by the printer, bitching about deadlines, stealing snacks from the breakroom,or pretending to work while online shopping.

I folded my arms and stared her down. "If no one saw you, no one can back up your story. Maybe you should've thought of a better lie than that."

Her lips trembled.

Then the tears came-messy, theatrical, just the right amount of pitiful to stir sympathy in the cheap seats.

"Mirabelle, I swear I told you! Why would I lie? I know you think I'm inexperienced. Fine, I am just a fresh grad, but I take my job seriously. It means everything to me. You can't say that... you'll get me fired!"

Violet Lin glided over and handed Chloe a tissue."Mira,come on. Chloe's never had any beef with you. Why would she leave you out on purpose? You were late and you're just lashing out at a newbie."

Another one jumped in. "Yeah, poor Chloe. She'd never do that on purpose. Look at her. She's crushed."
"She's the first one in, last one out. Always working her arse off. Don't throw her under the bus like that."

The crowd murmured their approval.

Apparently, I was now the wicked witch who picked on interns for sport.

I let out a slow breath. "I haven't even raised my voice,and she's already sobbing like I keyed her car. No one saw you tell me, Chloe. You've got no proof. I'm the one you were allegedly talking to, and I don't remember it happening. Make that make sense. Or we can just check the security footage."

Her eyes were red, nose running, full-on ugly crying now. "I did tell you, I swear! It just so happened no one saw it. You were late, you almost screwed everything up, and now you're blaming me because you're scared of getting in trouble!"

She sniffled. "If you really want to throw accusations at me, fine. I'm the lowest-ranking nobody here. All I do is fetch coffee and alphabetize the stationery cupboard. I'll just quit."

And boom-crowd reaction.

Gasps.Murmurs. An entire chorus of "don't quit, Chloe!"bursting out like she'd just announced she had two days to live.

"Alright,enough!"

Savannah smacked thetable like a judge.

"I don't care if Chloe forgot to pass the message or if Mirabelle hit snooze too many times. This mess ends now. From today on, every communication gets documented-text, email, whatever. Meeting over."

The crowd scattered.


I left with my jaw tight and my face frozen in neutral.

Right before I reached the door, I caught Violet Lin watching me,smirking


###Chapter 61I Quit
Minutes later, Violet Lin sashayed back to her desk.


Her smug little smirk said it all: she thought she'd bagged the project.


As she passed me, she let out a little scoff.


Had she pulled something shady again? Probably.


I didn't bite. Didn't even blink in her direction.


My proposal was solid.


But showing up late this morning was a stain l couldn't scrub off.


If I were Eliza Black, I wouldn't trust someone who couldn't read a clock either.


Thirty agonizing minutes later, Savannah stepped out of the office with her phone still in hand.


From the look on her face, she'd just hung up.
"Eliza Black's people got back to us," she said,scanning the room. "She picked Violet Lin."


Silence.



Then-



"Really?" Violet gasped, one hand clapped to her cheek like she'd just been proposed to. "Eliza Black actually picked me?"


Savannah nodded. "Yes. Prep starts now. Contract's getting signed tomorrow. The budget's generous,and this project's top priority. Violet, build your team.Everyone else, give her full support. I want a completed design draft on my desk as soon as humanly possible."


"Got it," Violet chirped.


Her eyes locked on me.


I knew that look.



Knew exactly what she was about to pull.


"Mirabelle," she said, sugary sweet. "Be my assistant?"



Assistant?



Please.


That was just a fancy word for errand girl in Violet's dictionary.


The kind who fetches lattes and hauls garment bags up five flights of stairs because the lift's out-yeah,that kind.


I'd seen her pull this stunt before.


She called it team building.


I called it hazing.


Last time, she ran some poor intern into the ground,sent her up and down the building so many times the girl nearly passed out.


The girl quit the day after.


I would've too.



And now she was trying it on me.
Across the room, Savannah caught my eye.


I didn't say anything, just raised my brow a fraction.


She knew it wasn't protocol for one designer to play lapdog to another.


But Violet got in first.


"This project's a big deal," she said, all sweet and reasonable. "I just want to make sure there are no mistakes. Mirabelle, you're okay with helping out,right? If Eliza Black's happy, that's a win for all of us.Gotta think about the company."



Savannah hesitated, lips pursed.


"Violet's the lead, we'll go with her arrangement,"she said.


Her tone was flat, but her eyes flicked to me.


She wasn't thrilled either.



Too bad the client had already picked sides.



Violet was about two seconds away from gloating when I leaned back in my chair and said, "Yeah, no.I'm not doing it."


Her smile twitched.


I was still fuming about the job being yanked from under me, and now Violet had the nerve to bounce over like a rabid cheerleader, trying to stick me with the grunt work.


Hell no.


Seniority. Skill. Portfolio.


I ticked every damn box.


At Nyx Collective, I wasn't just a designer-l was THE designer.


I'd rather jump in front of a moving bus than work as Violet's assistant.



I stood. "Not happening. I'm taking leave."


Violet blinked, fake-shocked. "Oh, don't be dramatic.It's just one project. You're not seriously quitting because you don't want to assist me?"
Then she got all performative. "If you were the lead designer and I had to assist, I'd totally cooperate."


"That's cute," I said. "But if I were the lead, I'd rather rope in Paul the Octopus to help me sketch than let you anywhere near my project. At least he had better accuracy. And taste. Besides, I don't need this job badly enough to play your stooge."


Violet didn't expect me to hit back that hard.


Her eyes narrowed, and she slithered closer.


"Mira, come on, we both know you need this job.You've got no family backing you, and I heard the wedding with Rhys Granger got called off. If you lose this job too... how are you going to survive?"


I barked a laugh. "Worried about me? Thanks, but save it. What you really need to worry about is yourself. When Eliza Black shows up in your design looking like a cautionary tale, you won't just be losing face like you did at the Laurent party. This time,it'll be international. Front row, high-def, full-on global humiliation. Should be fun."
That shut her up.



Then my phone buzzed on the table.


I picked it up, expecting some spam or another passive-aggressive group chat message.



Nope.


It was a text from the bank.



Account balance update.



I blinked.



Counted the zeroes.



Twice.



Two. Million. Dollars.



What the actual-?



I figured the bank had glitched or something.



Like, maybe it accidentally thought | was Alice Walton for the day.
Then another message buzzed through, this time from Dominic Everett, Ashton's assistant.


[Mrs. Laurent, Mr. Laurent has requested a new card be issued in your name. A monthly deposit of one million will be made as agreed. An additional million is Mr. Laurent's personal gift to you. Please confirm receipt.]


I stared at the screen for two whole minutes.


Not blinking. Not breathing.


"As agreed"?


When had I agreed to receive a million dollars from Ashton?


And from the sound of it, this was going to be a monthly thing.


I didn't marry Ashton for his money.


Hell, I barely listened to whatever he said in the dark hallway that day; I was too busy ogling.


But now, with two million just chilling in my account like it was pocket change, I couldn't lie-l felt it in my bones.
Money really did slap different.
Sure, I'd always known Ashton was rich, but this was the moment it truly hit me.
I was now officially one of those people who could buy a whole boutique just because the salesgirl looked at me funny.
Across from me, Violet Lin waved a hand in front of my face. "Earth to Mira. Why are you staring at your phone so hard? Trying to find another job already?"
I blinked out of it, shoved my phone into my bag, and got to my feet.
When Violet tried to block my path, I shouldered her aside.

Everyone in the studio turned to gape at me.
I shot them all a look, grabbed my bag, and announced: "I quit,bitches!"
###Chapter 62 Silver Spoon Treatment
It wasn't until I'd strutted out of the building that l realized maybe I'd been a tad impulsive.


But holy shit, it felt good.


I was halfway down the street when my phone rang.


"Mrs. Laurent," Dominic greeted.



I physically flinched.



Hearing it out loud was way worse than seeing it in a text.



"Mr.Everett."


"Please, just call me Dom. I just wanted to remind you," he went on, all polite and corporate, "that if there's no activity on the card, the account will be frozen before the next monthly deposit."

I stopped dead on the pavement. "What do you mean 'frozen'?"
"I mean you must spend the funds. There needs to be a transaction history, or the account locks automatically."
I stared at my reflection in a shop window.

My mouth opened.
Nothing came out.
What the hell kind of bougie, dystopian Barbie card needed 'mandatory spending'?

"Um, got it. Thanks, Dominic."
Just as I was about to hang up, he added, "When will you be moving in with Mr. Laurent?"
Oh,right. The move.
That little formality I'd been pretending didn't exist.
"I'm free this week, so-"
"Perfect. Let's do today. I'll bring the team to  Oakwood Apartments now."
"Wait, I don't need-"
He hung up.
I bolted straight back to Oakwood.
When I got there, Dominic was already outside the building, standing next to three strangers.
"Mrs. Laurent," he said with a smooth smile, "this is Mr. Laurent's housekeeper, and these two are household staff. They'll assist you with the packing."
"Right. Cool. Thanks, everyone," I said, giving them a nod like I did this sort of thing all the time and wasn't screaming internally.
They moved like a corporate SWAT team-efficient,silent, scarily precise.
Within an hour, my entire life was bubble-wrapped and boxed.

The place was scrubbed clean like I never existed.
Not a stray sock, not a rogue bobby pin, not even a ghost of last night's takeaway.
I'd planned on keeping the flat for a rainy-day escape.
But nope, Dominic's crew went full Marie Kondo on it,and now the vibe was less 'backup home' and more 'sterile Airbnb'.
"Mrs. Laurent, shall we?" The housekeeper,Geoffrey Croft-mid-forties, crisp accent, dressed like a high-end funeral planner-stood at attention by the SUV,ready to cart me off to Ashton's lair.
The man had manners like he'd been downloaded straight from Downton Abbey.
I nodded. "Yeah. Let's go."
I already knew Ashton didn't live in the main Laurent mansion-the one that hosted that horror show of a party.
Geoffrey told me his boss preferred a more low-key residence.
Well, Ashton's version of 'low-key' turned out to be a three-storey white villa that looked almost humble from the outside-right up until the gates opened.
There was a driveway.
A parking lot.
An actual swimming pool.
A tennis court.
An outdoor barbecue area.
Even a vegetable garden.
Dominic gave me a curt nod. "I'll head back to the office, Mrs. Laurent. Geoffrey will show you around."
"Right. Thanks. See you."
Geoffrey led me around the grounds.
The backyard had a swing hanging from an old oak tree.
It looked just like the one from my childhood home.
"Mr. Laurent has been living abroad for several years," Geoffrey explained. "He purchased this property some time ago but only started living here this year. It was just me and one other housekeeper until recently. More staff have joined since. If anyone falls short, please do let me know."
I gave him a nod. "Noted."

Inside, the house was ridiculous.
Each floor felt like it had its own postcode.
Spa room, indoor cinema, security control hub, panic room.

But I nodded along as Geoffrey prattled on.
Couldn't have the staff thinking I was just some pretty face who didn't know the difference between a wine cellar and a weapons vault.
By the time we wrapped the tour, my feet were dead and my brain was mush.

I crawled into bed for what was meant to be a ten-minute lie-down and passed out like a corpse.
When I woke up, the sky was pitch-black and someone was knocking on the door.
"Mrs. Laurent, it's Carmen Alvarez," a woman's voice said.
Probably the other housekeeper Geoffrey told me about.
"Mrs. Laurent, dinner's almost ready."
Mrs.Laurent.
Ugh.
That title still feltlike a boot I hadn't broken in yet.
"Thanks, I'll be right down," I said, after a beat.
I threw on my clothes, shoved my feet into new slippers that were magically my size, and padded downstairs.
Ashton had texted earlier saying he wouldn't be back tonight, and I'd damn near done a cartwheel.
The dining table looked like it belonged in a Michelin ad, everything plated so precisely it made me want to ruin it just out of spite.
I ate like I hadn't tasted real food in years.
Before I could even set my fork down, a staff member swept in and cleared the table.
Then another guy showed up, all smiles and polish."Would you prefer a digestif or coffee, madam?"
"Coffee would be nice, thanks."
"Any preference? With cream? Sugar?"
"Just cream, no sugar."
"We have Jamaican Blue Mountain, Hawaiian Kona,or Saint Helena.Fresh ground, of course."
Before I could process any of that, he was already moving on. "Would you care for a stroll through the grounds? I'd be happy to show you the way. Or perhaps a lap in the pool? I'll heat it right away if you like."
I waved him off.
The whole thing was too much.

I wasn't used to all this silve spoon treatment.

Sure, my family was well-off, but nothing close to this whole being-waited-on-hand-and-foot level.

But now I was Ashton's wife.

On paper,at least.

And I had to play the role just convincingly enough that no one started asking questions they weren't supposed to.
###Chapter 63 Jewellery Porn
My first night at the house passed without incident,and without a single sighting of Ashton.



The next morning, I jolted awake to my alarm before remembering-I'd torched my job at Nyx Collective.


Just as I was basking in my unemployment glow,someone knocked on the door.



"Come in."



Carmen Alvarez stepped in, followed by what looked like half the staff of Harrods on Black Friday.



Racks of clothes, shoe boxes stacked like Jenga towers, handbags, coats, dresses for every season and occasion-all designer, all new, all in my size.


"I'll arrange these in the closet," Carmen said,already directing her team like a runway general.
"There's no need. Really. I don't need this many clothes. Just send them back," I said after gawking for a full minute.


"These were selected from Mr. Laurent's preferred designers. All pieces are custom-ordered for you.Returns aren't part of the arrangement."


I was halfway to telling her where to stick the "arrangement" when it hit me-right,the role.


Ashton's doting wife wouldn't pitch a fit about couture.



I pasted on a smile that was more grimace than anything and nodded.


While Carmen's crew buzzed around the walk-in,Geoffrey Croft appeared, balancing trays on both arms.



This time, I sat up straighter.


The trays were lined with velvet boxes.



Jewelry.
Now he had my attention.


Geoffrey opened one box at a time.


A platinum necklace with Colombian emeralds cut so clean they looked radioactive.


A cuff bracelet in brushed rose gold with pavédiamonds wrapped in a helix design.


One pair of earrings had sapphires so deep and inky they looked like bottled midnight.


The craftsmanship made me want to cry and then steal it all.


"There will be fresh deliveries every month," Geoffrey said."The latest from Mr. Laurent's usual ateliers."


I barely heard him.


My hands were twitching like a toddler in a toy store.


This was basically porn for a jewelry designer.


I spent the rest of the morning cocooned in my room,surrounded by enough gemstones to fund a minor coup.



If Ashton had walked in right then, I might've kissed him to Sunday and back, no questions asked.


When Carmen knocked on my door for what had to be the twentieth time, I reluctantly peeled myself off the carpet, where I'd been having a deeply spiritual moment with a tray of diamond chokers, and trudged downstairs for breakfast.



Post-eggs-and-something-l-couldn't-pronounce, I headed back to my room and yanked out my old BloomState pitch.


It had already been rejected, sure, but I wasn't ready to bin it.



I liked it. A lot.



It wasn't some trend-chasing fluff cooked up to impress Eliza.


It was personal.


I'd poured too much of myself into this one.
Might as well flesh it out properly, turn it into something real.


I'd already decided when I opened my own jewelry studio,BloomState would be the first line I launched.


Besides, the jewelry haul this morning had totally juiced my inspiration.


Seeing all those pieces from Cartier, Graff,Boucheron...


It was like taking a masterclass in stone setting,symmetry,and detail.


I scribbled a few new layout ideas, reworked my bezel placements, fiddled with a hybrid claw tension mount I'd never quite cracked.



Then my phone rang.



"Hello?"



"Hi, Mira, it's me, Finn."


"Yes, my favorite lawyer."
He snorted. "Ten bucks says I'm the only lawyer you know."



"Ha,you caught me."


"Are you busy right now?"


I spun a pencil between my fingers. "Believe it or not,I'm free as a bird."



"On a Monday morning?"


"Long story. What's up?"


"I was gonna ask if you could meet later this evening,but if you're free, want to come down to my office now? It's about the case."


"You've reviewed the stuff I sent you?"


"All of it. Audio, video, it's an absolute goldmine.Since the defamation's both written and spoken, I'm amending the complaint to include libel and slander.More charges, more damages, as we lawyers like to say."



"Good."
"| need to go over it all with you-evidence, potential witnesses, rough timeline, damage estimates, the works."



"Sounds like a long meeting."


"Might be. Don't worry, I'll buy you lunch if we go over."



"Deal."



Geoffrey offered to have the car brought around, but I waved him off; I was already feeling like Elly May Clampett from The Beverly Hillbillies.



At Finn's office, he looked like something out of "Suits," all pressed lines and smug competence.


"Damn, you clean up well," I said.


He grinned."Court appearance this afternoon. Gotta look the part or the judge assumes I still live with my mum."



We got into the case while a paralegal made notes.


Somewhere between dissecting screenshots and playing a particularly juicy voice memo, we took a break.


Finn leaned back. "Gotta say, I was shocked when l found out you and Rhys were a thing. Even more shocked when I heard you weren't. But after hearing all this," he gestured at the mountain of evidence I'd brought, "I'm honestly surprised you didn't dump him sooner."



I gave a rueful laugh. "Yeah, love is blind, deaf,and possibly concussed. Took me forever to realize he wasn't the man I thought he was."


"So... you single now?" he asked, like it was nothing.


My brain immediately sprinted to Ashton.


And our fake marriage.


And the fact that I didn't have a ring to prove it.


I must've paused too long, because Finn backtracked with a wince. "Sorry, I didn't mean to-"


"No, it's fine," I cut in. "I'm not dating anyone right Jewellery Porn now."
Which, strictly speaking, wasn't a lie.

Finn checked his watch. "You hungry? Let's head out for lunch."
said, grabbing my phone and standing up."But I'm buying."
He chuckled. "Alright, but I'm picking the place.There's this little bistro near Park & Fifth. They've got the best spicy Cacio e Pepe in the city."

I blinked. "Ha. You remembered."

"Of course I did."
Minutes later, we slid into a booth at the bistro and ordered.
Once the waiter left, I leaned back and said, "So.Catch me up. What's life been like post-graduation?
You know my story now. What about yours? Seeing anyone?"
He shook his head. "Lawyer life's a black hole. Billing hours kills romance. Plus... I'm waiting for the right girl."
###Chapter 64 Ashton's POV: Red Flag
While Mirabelle was sitting in the bistro with Finn,ten miles away and sixty-eight floors up, Ashton finally found out-second-hand-that she was suing Rhys Granger.


The moment the glass doors to his office swung shut, Ashton hurled a thick stack of contracts straight at Cassian Langford's chest.


The hit landed with a meaty smack.


"Why the hell didn't you tell me earlier?"


Cassian stumbled back, one hand catching the papers, the other slapped to his ribs. "Jesus, mate,trying to bruise a lung or what?"


Ashton didn't answer.



The tension in his jaw said plenty.
Cassian straightened, rubbing at his ribs with exaggerated flair. "Look, I didn't know either,alright?It's not like Rhys and I are besties in a group chat.How the fuck was I supposed to know he was running his mouth?"


"Then how do you know now?"



"Yvaine's birthday party. Mirabelle had a go at him.Rhys and his girlfriend were both there. Things got...messy.I just kinda forgot to mention it."



Ashton's jaw flexed again.



His eyes were already dark, but now they looked like wet asphalt before a storm.


"When was her birthday?"


"Three days ago? You told me to go,remember?"


Another folder slammed into Cassian's shoulder.


"And what exactly did I tell you to do at that party?Ogle the influencers? I said watch Mirabelle. That prick Granger was dragging her name through the dirt and you didn't think to open your mouth?"


Cassian held up his hands. "Look, it wasn't that bad.Yvaine backed her up, and Rhys fucked off with his girlfriend. Situation handled. Plus, Mirabelle's got a lawyer. She's already suing him. What more can you do?"



Ashton jabbed the intercom. "Get Legal up here.Now."



Cassian sank into an armchair and watched while Ashton launched a barrage of clipped instructions at the head of Legal.


Once the door clicked shut behind the lawyer,Cassian gave Ashton a slow once-over and clicked his tongue.


"What?"


Cassian clicked again, grinning. "Just... never seen you like this. You're properly gone for her, aren't you?"


Ashton's answer was bone-dry. "Didn't I tell you at The Rookery?"
"Yeah, yeah. About how you met her years ago and it was all fate and stardust or whatever. But I don't get the same energy from her, you know?"
Ashton's eyes narrowed. "What energy."

"The one you're radiating right now." Cassian pointed at him. "That look on your face whenever her name comes up. You need a mirror, mate. You're practically glowing. Your eyes are sparkling like a fucking TikTok filter."
"If you've got time to sit there sounding like an extra from Gossip Girl, you've got time to leave."

Cassian smirked. "What, are you shy now? Come on,Ash, we've been through hell together. I thought I'd seen every version of you. Turns out I missed the one who acts like a high school kid on his first date."

Ashton flicked him a glance. "Not all of us were teenage Don Juans."

"I'd prefer to be called a young DiCaprio. Anyway,I  was chatting with her at Yvaine's party, right? Tried to dig a little. For your sake, obviously."


"I told you to keep an eye on her. Not interrogate her."



Cassian raised both hands. "Whoa, calm down. If it's illegal to be a concerned friend, throw the cuffs on.Anyway, I asked her a few things-normal stuff. She was polite, yeah, but guarded. Real careful. Didn't give me a damn thing I could use."


Before Ashton could snap at him again, Cassian added in a hurry, "Not that I was looking for things to use against her. But you know how it is, people in our circle burn each other for sport. Doesn't hurt to do due diligence,right?"


Ashton nodded for him to continue.



"Everyone knows about her and Rhys. They were engaged, what, three years? Four? That's practically a decade in our world. Then she dumps him and marries you in less time than it takes me to replace my tailor. You can't tell me that's not a red flag."
<###Chapter 64 ###Chapter 64 Ashton's POV: Red Flag  +120 Points at most "I told you already," Ashton cut in, sharp. "I pushed for the marriage. She didn't want it.I did."

Cassian held his hands up again. "Alright, alright.Don't bite my head off. I'm just saying, if this isn't just another PR stunt and she's actually your wife-wife,then I should get to know her. She's gonna be part of your life, which means she's gonna be part of mine."

Ashton didn't respond. His silence gave Cassian room to keep digging.

"So, yeah. I asked. Prodded a bit. And... I gotta be honest, man, I don't think she feels the same about you."

Ashton stilled.
Cassian pressed on. "She didn't seem to remember Florence. Or Eindhoven. At least, not the way you remember them."

The silence stretched.

Ashton didn't flinch, didn't blink, didn't react at all.

But Cassian had known him long enough to spot the way his shoulders lowered just a fraction.


"You didn't tell her, did you?" Cassian asked, more gently now.


"Tell her what?"


"That you love her."


Ashton turned away without answering.


He walked to the window.



The skyline pulsed under him, this city he'd once sworn off.



He'd come back anyway.


For her.



"I haven't," he said finally.


"Why the fuck not? If I like a girl, I tell her. 'Oi, be my girlfriend. Done. If I'm dumb enough to want to marry her-God forbid-I'll just say it. But you? You've been circling her like a damn border collie. You, of all people. Mr 'You're fired' before the coffee's cold.Now you're moving like every step migh blow up."


Ashton finally turned. "If you were carrying a fifteenth-century Flemish reliquary, one-of-a-kind,irreplaceable, would you be sprinting with it?" He let that sit for a beat. "Didn't think so."



Cassian groaned, dragged a hand down his face."Jesus.Mirabelle's not a fragile relic, Ashton. She's a woman.A pretty tough one at that. You're acting like she'll crack if you breathe too hard near her."


"| don't want to scare her off." Ashton's voice dropped lower, rougher. "She's not ready. Not yet."


Not until he'd erased Rhys Granger from every inch of her life.



His fingers curled against the desk.


The same fingers that had once skimmed her body.


The same ones that had memorized the curve of her waist, the softness of her thigh, the exact moment she'd stopped pulling away.
Now they twitched like they wanted to smash something.

Preferably Rhys's jawbone.

Cassian looked at him sideways. "You planning on waiting forever?"
###Chapter 65 Netflix and Chill,in Reverse Order

When I got back from Finn's office, Geoffrey greeted me with his usual calm face and a little bombshell.
"Mr.Laurent will be dining at home tonight."
Which meant he'd probably be sleeping here tonight.Great.
Not that I was expected to do the whole wife routine in bed-thank God-but still, I was nervous.
Dinner was being served when he walked in.
We sat across from each other, all polished cutlery and polite silences.
He looked like he was waiting for me to say something, but I had no idea what.
Then he asked after the first course, "I heard Rhys Granger's been telling people you cheated on him?"


I nodded.


Soon, Rhys was going to get a nice little surprise in the form of a lawsuit.


"He's talking shit," I said dismissively, reaching for my wine. "My lawyer's on it."


Ashton dished risotto onto my plate with a serving spoon.


He did it so naturally, like he'd been doing it for ages instead of for the first time.



"I always said Rhys Granger's unstable."


"You're probably right." I stabbed a piece of asparagus. "Well, this time, I'm not letting it slide.He wants to lie, he can lie to the judge."


Ashton's lips quirked.


Barely.


But I caught it.
"Let LGH's legal team handle ii,he said."They've got more experience with this kind of thing."



I stopped chewing and looked up slowly. "Isn't that overkill?"



The LGH legal team handled mergers that shook stock markets.



Using them to drag Rhys's sorry ass through court over a defamation case felt like bringing a bazooka to a pillow fight.


"Finn said the evidence is solid. He won't guarantee a win, but there's a good chance-"



Ashton cut me off. "You're Mrs. Laurent. My company's legal team exists to protect our interests,and that nowv includes you. If Rhys thinks he can drag your name through the mud, he's picking a fight with me. LGH is getting involved whenever a Laurent's involved, that's protocol."



"Fine. I'll talk to Finn." I wasn't sure if Finn would appreciate the extra legal muscle or resent the intrusion. "He's already put a lot of effort into the case, though. Can he still run point?"


"Sure."


We dropped the subject.


And with it, every last scrap of conversation.


The silence didn't just settle; it took up residence,moved in with a suitcase, and made itself at home between us.


When I finished eating, I set my fork down and stared at my plate.


What now?



Was | supposed to wait obediently like some Victorian housewife, or just stand up and leave like this was a public restaurant?


Geoffrey was loitering nearby like a very polite ghost,another waiter flanking him.


Not exactly the people | could ask about post-dinner etiquette in a situationship.
I racked my brain for a way to fill the silence.


Small talk was a dead end-l'd already burned through the classic "how was your day" the moment Ashton sat down, and something told me he wouldn't be thrilled with a thirty-minute monologue on micro-pavé settings or the ethics of synthetic diamonds in haute joaillerie.


There was something I wanted to ask, though.


Was he sleeping here tonight?


And more pressingly-where?


When Carmen and Geoffrey staged a surprise boutique explosion in my room that morning, there were no men's clothes in sight.


But that didn't mean anything.


Maybe Ashton had his own dressing room.


Or maybe he didn't need sleep.


Maybe he hung upside down in a hyperbaric chamber like some Armani-wrapped bat.
But if I asked... would it come off wrong?


It was his house, after all.


He didn't need my permission to stay.


If I sounded like I didn't want him here, that might be rude.



On the other hand, if I sounded too curious, would it read like an invitation?



Because let's be real, "Are you sleeping here tonight?" sounds like a question only a hotel manager could pull off.


Or a mistress checking her sugar daddy's schedule.


I internally facepalmed. "It's a yes or no question,dumbass," I hissed at myself. "Ask it. Use your mouth. You're not twelve."



But a snarkier voice in my head rolled her eyes."It's Ashton Laurent. You don't casually ask him about his sleeping arrangements. If you had dinner with J. P.Morgan, you wouldn't ask if his hotel had turndown service. You'd ask about interest rates. Or the future of the country's financial system."


I risked a peek across the table.


He was sitting there like the ghost of European nobility, sipping wine.


His fingers, long, elegant, dusted with calluses,wrapped around the glass stem with effortless control.


And when he swallowed, his Adam's apple shifted ever so slightly.


I had the strongest, dumbest urge to lean over and lick it.



Jesus.



"Look away, you thirsty gremlin," I barked at myself."Stop leering like a perv."


No wonder people always say"movie, dinner, then sex."





Or, in Gen Z speak, "Netflix and chill," with the heavy emphasis on the "chill."



There's a rhythm to it. A build-up.


Dinner after sex just felt... off.



Like watching the end credits first, then hitting play.


I'd done it all backwards, jumped Ashton's bones before even learning his first name, married him after, and now here we were, eating risotto in weird,loaded silence like a couple on a first date who'd already seen each other naked.


It was just...awkward.


I didn't know what the hell the next move was supposed to be.


"You don't have to wait for me," Ashton said, not looking up."You can go do your thing."


"Great," I said, already halfway to the stairs.

###Chapter 66 Ashton's POV: She's into Him. Maybe
Ashton watched Mirabelle flee the dining room without a backward glance.



He set his wine glass down. "How's she settling in?"



Geoffrey stepped forward. "Mrs. Laurent mostly stayed in her room and worked on her sketches.She dropped by a law firm earlier today. Came back right after."



"Stayed in? She didn't go to the office?"


He remembered her telling him last week about some big campaign Nyx Collective was preparing.


A career-defining launch, apparently.



He pulled out his phone.


"Find out what's going on at Nyx," he said the second Cassian picked up. "Ask Yvaine Carlisle.Don't make it obvious."
Cassian groaned. "Mate, I'm your bloody best man,not your PA. Nor your wife's. Why don't you just ask Mirabelle yourself? Or are you two not on speaking terms?"
"Do it." Ashton hung up.
He stared at the screen.

Then at his untouched plate.

The steak tasted like cardboard.

The wine like vinegar.
Cassian's words pissed him off more than he cared to admit.
He'd married her.
She'd moved in.
That was already a win, considering how allergic she was to commitment, post-Rhys.
But that was about it.
They lived in the same damn house, ate at the same table, and somehow she still looked at him like he was her boss during a performance review.
Earlier, at dinner, her smile had been a dead giveaway.
It was the same kind customer service reps gave-polite, bland, entirely devoid of meaning.
Still, he hadn't missed the way her eyes kept darting over him when she thought he wasn't looking.

Over his jaw, his hands, his throat.

She didn't know what it did to him.

Maybe she didn't realize her gaze had weight, like a touch he could feel without being touched, soft and slow and impossible to ignore, dragging heat across his skin wherever it landed.

So yeah. She was into his body.

At least there was that.
But it was a transient, superficial, Chippendales-level interest-she was all in for the show, front row,drooling over the abs and hip thrusts... but she'd never take the dancer home.

Not when the lights came up.

Not when real life started.
Ashton ran a hand through his hair, annoyed with himself, with his lack of progress.

He didn't want to be her temporary obsession, some aesthetic she played with until the next whim took over.

He wanted in.

Into her thoughts, her trust, her fucking life.
She'd been accused of something serious, and her first instinct was to go it alone.

She didn't mention it to him.

The thought of asking for his help probably never even crossed her mind.
The tight,low-simmering frustration had been riding his nerves all day, and by midnight, it hit boiling point.
Ashton's bedroom was on the east side of the second floor, two doors down from hers.
As he stepped out to get water, his eyes flicked to the right.
Light spilled from under Mirabelle's door.
She seemed to be on the verge of stepping out.
But the second she heard his door click open, she froze.
Then-faster than a blink-she ducked back inside and killed the lights.

So. She'd wanted to come out too.
Probably for water.
Or a snack.
Or something less innocent, if he let himself hope.
But the second she saw him, she bolted like the idea of being near him was worse than thirst.


Ashton let out a slow breath, ran a hand through his hair, and walked downstairs without a backward glance.


He didn't want to spook her more than she already was.





He filled a glass at the kitchen island,then wandered over to the living room and dropped onto the leather sofa,phone in hand.


From where he sat, he had a perfect view of her bedroom door upstairs.



A sliver of it eased open.


No lights inside, just blackness and a glint of curiosity.





She peeked out.


He didn't move.



Didn't even look directly at her.
The door snapped shut again.
His mouth twitched.
He sipped his water. Slowly.
Took him ten minutes to finishit.
Her door opened again.
A crack.
Then closed.
Again.

Closed.
He leaned his head back against the sofa and laughed under his breath,the sound bitter.
She'd rather get dehydrated than be stuck in the same space with him for five damn seconds?
He clenched his phone in one hand and typed without looking.
[You've dated more girls than live in half the zip codes in Skyline. How the hell do you get them to fall for you?]



He sent it to Cassian.



Who took his sweet time replying.


[Mate, it's two in the fucking morning. You need meds. Or a new friend. Or a brain doc. Mirabelle's already your wife. You've got her exactly where you wanted. What more do you want? Her heart? Soul?Here's a link to Top 10 Ways to Be a Valentine Without Being a Psycho. You're welcome. Now piss off and let me sleep.]



Ashton slammed the phone face-down into the sofa cushion.



He should have known better than to ask relationship advice from a man who swapped girlfriends faster than most people changed razor blades.


Still, Cassian wasn't wrong about one thing-he'd already got Mirabelle exactly where he wanted.


She was under his roof now.
There'd be plenty of chances for... further interaction.





He rinsed his glass in the kitchen sink, then made his way upstairs.


But instead of heading into his room, he stopped right behind the door and waited, a juvenile thing he'd never done before.



Didn't take long.


Light footsteps.


Barely audible.


Soft,fast, like someone trying not to be heard.


She had to pass his room to get downstairs.


He eased the door open a crack.


There she was.



Mirabelle was in a white slip, tiptoeing across the marble like a thief.
###Chapter 67 Ashton's POV: His and Hers

Mirabelle was holding up the hem of her nightgown with two fingers, her steps careful and silent.


No shoes.



Just bare feet on cold black stone, each step like a spotlight in the dark.


Her skin looked warm against all that sleek obsidian.


Pale. Almost glowing.


Ashton's gaze tracked up the curve of her calves to the back of her thighs, then higher, past the sway of fabric.


The dress clung to her hips and draped off her waist as if it had been designed for temptation.


Through the thin material, he caught the outline of her spine, the dip where her back met her hips, the faintest tease of her-



Ashton swallowed hard.



Then shut the door.



Fast. Quiet.


Teeth clenched, jaw locked, forehead against the wood.





"Fucking pervert," he muttered under his breath.


He was supposed to be a grown man, not some hormonal teen hiding behind doors to stare at a woman's ass.



He didn't move.


Just stood there, breathing like he'd run a mile, while she padded around downstairs.


Eventually, he heard her coming back up, just as quietly as before.


Once the footsteps passed his room, he peeled away from the door, grabbed a towel, and marched straight into the en suite.


He needed a cold shower.



A long one.



***



Mirabelle was already there when Ashton came into the dining room the next morning.


She'd changed-yellow jumper, jeans, fluffy socks.


Cozy.Casual.


Warm in a way that made his throat feel tight again,and not because of lust this time.


She looked... comfortable. Like she'd finally settled into this place.


She yawned when she thought he wasn't looking.


"You don't need to get up this early," he said,heading to the coffee machine. "Got somewhere to be?"
She shrugged. "Nah. I'm on leave."


He'd heard all about it from Cassian-the new project,the competition, the collegial rivalry.


He even knew her boss, Savannah something, had called her repeatedly in the past couple of days,trying to get her to come back to Nyx.


Mirabelle had said no.


What was her plan? To find another studio? Start her own? Take a sabbatical?


More to the point, when did she plan on telling him?


After the fact? Over dinner?



Or maybe never?


Ashton pulled out a chair and sat across from her."Something happen at work?"


She stirred her coffee.."Nothing huge. Just needed a break."



That was a lie, obviously, but he didn't push.
Not yet.


They ate in silence for a few minutes.


He glanced at her over his toast. "Got any plans today?"



"Yeah. Gonna swing by the law firm again." She gave him a quick smile. "Your legal team's scary efficient.They emailed me last night."


"Good." He nearly told her to have the meeting at the LGH building instead-preferably in his office-but held it back.



"Then I'll catch up with Yvaine over tea."


"Let Geoffrey drive you."


Mirabelle glanced at the housekeeper, who beamed at her.



She forced a polite smile, then turned back to Ashton. "Public transport's fine. I don't want to trouble anyone."



"You drive?"
She nodded. "Got my license in college."


"Then take one of the cars."



Her fork paused mid-air. "You mean one of those rare, probably one-of-a-kind cars in your garage? If I so much as scratched the bumper, I'd have to sell a kidney just to cover the paint."



He smiled, then frowned.


He liked thnat she was comfortable enough to joke with him now, but he didn't like that she still saw the cars as his. Not hers.



Definitely not theirs.


"Right. My mistake. Those have been sitting in the garage too long. Probably need a tune-up before they're road-ready. What do you like driving?I'll have one sent over."


She dropped her fork like it had just bitten her. "Um,no, thanks. Really. I barely drive. Like, ever. I'd rather walk."
"Can't have people seeing you on the subway and thinking I'm some tight-fisted bastard," Ashton said smoothly. "So either you drive yourself, or someone drives you."


Mirabelle shifted in her seat, trying to squirm out of it. "Fine, I'll drive myself... I've still got that card your assistant gave me the other day. I'll buy something.Speaking of that-" she added, "I don't remember us agreeing on a million-dollar monthly transfer. Can you take it back?"


"No," he said flatly, his tone edged with irritation."You're my wife. There's a certain image that needs maintaining. That means having a driver. A card that skips queues. VIP access. The works. Non-negotiable."


"That wasn't in the deal," she shot back.


"Was it not?" he murmured, hiding a smug smile behind his coffee mug. "Maybe check the contract.Section Five. Subclause twenty."


"What?" she blinked, then muttered under her breath, "I don't even remember where the hell i shoved that damn thing."


He remembered, but he wasn't about to tell her.


He turned to Geoffrey and said, "Take Mrs. Laurent car shopping after breakfast."


"Nope," she jumped in fast. "Really. There's no need.I don't know a damn thing about cars anyway."


Ashton didn't miss a beat. "Then we'll have one delivered."



Which had been the plan from the start.


Mirabelle mumbled something to herself and gave in reluctantly.


After breakfast, she went upstairs to change.


Ashton said to Geoffrey, "Make sure she's comfortable with whatever you get."


"Of course,sir."


"And... get one that comes as a pair. The 'his and hers' type. Have mine delivered to the garage."
###Chapter 68 Rehearsal
An hour later, Dominic delivered a red Ferrari.


I took it out for a spin.


Wind in my hair, sunglasses on, death grip on the wheel.


I couldn't even remember the last time I'd driven, and I barely hit twenty miles an hour, gliding down the street likea pensioner on sleeping pills.


Geoffrey rode shotgun, grinning like a proud driving instructor, tossing out compliments as if I was doing laps at Silverstone.


But after a few blocks, muscle memory kicked in.


I loosened my grip, leaned back, and let the engine purr.


When I pulled back into the drive, there was an actual smile on my face.



That evening, just as I was about to retreat upstairs after dinner, Ashton said, "My grandfather's birthday's coming up. We'll need to attend together."


"Yeah, I remember." | stopped halfway up the stairs and flashed him an OK sign. "I'll be the perfect fake wife.Promise."



"The Laurents aren't idiots," he said. "Well, some of them, anyway. If we slip up, even slightly, they'll catch on. And if anyone starts thinking I'm not serious about this... that I'm using the marriage to manipulate Grandfather-"



"Say no more. What do you need me to do?"I dropped onto the sofa across from him, still riding the high from the Ferrari and feeling uncharacteristically agreeable.


He didn't answer right away.


He crossed one leg over the other, long limbs folded like he was posing for a Vogue editorial without even trying.


If this man ever got bored of being a powerful CEO,he'd make a killing on magazine covers.


Silence stretched again.


Then:



"We could rehearse," he said.



Real calm. Real nonchalant.



"Sure."I nodded.


In my mind, "rehearse" meant something chill.


A rundown of the backstory.


A fake engagement 101.


Maybe even a few lines to memorize so I didn't accidentally say we met on Bumble.


What I got was... choreography.


We stood side by side at the front door like a couple of understudies about to botch their big debut.
Ashton said, "We'll rehearse how we walk in."


I stared at him. "You're kidding."



He wasn't.



Apparently, we were doing blocking like it was West End week at the Laurent Estate.


I half expected a stage manager to pop out with cue cards.


It was kind of fun, but also... kind of awkward.


At least the house was empty.


Geoffrey and the staff had cleared out, so there was no one lurking to watch me embarrass myself in socks and a faded hoodie.



I relaxed. Slightly.


Then I glanced down at my slippers, then back at him. "We're going in dressed like this?"


"The costumes will come in later," he answered, as if he hadn't realized I was joking. "If you walk in that stiff, they'll see right through it. Get closer."


I shifted half a step toward him, already feeling oddly self-conscious. Then his hand landed on my waist from behind and pulled me inlike I was a prop that needed repositioning.


I slammed against him, chest to chest, all breath and heartbeat and...fuck.



I looked up, ready to make a joke about personal space.


He was looking down.


Our faces were so close I could smell his cologne and feel his breath on my cheek.


I looked away.Fast.


His hand didn't move.


In fact, it tightened.


"Focus," he murmured.


"Fine," I muttered, eyes glued to the floor.
He slid his arm more snugly around my waist and started guiding us forward, leading like we were about to waltz into high society instead of the living room.
We made it from the door to the sofa and back again.Twice.
He stopped. "No. This won't cut it. We're way too stiff.Anyone with eyes will know we're faking it."

I licked my lips. "So what do we do?"

"We can't just walk like strangers and hope no one notices. If we want them to buy this, we need chemistry. Real intimacy. And we need to cultivate it."

"And how exactly do we 'cultivate' that?" | asked,air-quoting with my fingers.

"We start simple. With a hug."

I stared at him.

I mean, technically he was my husband now, but mentally I was still stuck in that awkward co-tenant headspace where our deepest bond was shared Wi-Fi.





A hug?


I wasn't ready.


My soul wasn't ready.


Honestly, even Rhys and I had rarely hugged-and that was a man I'd seriously been in love with.


I took a step back.


Ashton took one forward.


I moved again.


So did he.


It went on like some ridiculous mating dance until my back hit the bloody kitchen island and I had nowhere else to go.


He tilted his head slightly, bringing his face level with mine.



His voice was a low purr against my ear. "Would you be willing to give it a try, as a favor to me? Please?"


The hairs on my neck stood up.


So did other things I wasn't going to acknowledge in public.


Of course, I turned bright red.


Why was this man leaking sex appeal like it was his second job?


I clenched my jaw. "Yeah. Fine. Let's do it."


Acting. That's all it was.


I'd watched enough TV growing up to fake a convincing hug.


I could channel every romcom heroine who ever had to pretend she didn't want to jump the male lead's bones.



Easy.


Ashton opened his arms, waiting.


I took a deep breath, muttered something unrepeatable under it, then stepped into his arms.


And yeah, alright, he felt... expensive.


His cotton Henley was soft.


His body was not.


I wrapped my arms around his waist and instantly hit a wall of solid muscle under all that casual fabric.


Bloody hell. The man was built like a secret weapon.


His hands settled on my back, one at my waist, one brushing my shoulder.


He gave me a light tap, almost a pat. "Relax."


Easy for him to say.


He wasn't the one trying not to pass out from pheromone overdose.
###Chapter 69 Trust Issues
Ashton's hand moved in slow, careful strokes against my back, and after a couple of minutes that felt like twenty, my spine finally stopped trying to eject itself.


Weird detail to notice, but I liked how soft his shirt was.


And how he smelled-clean, expensive, with a faint,woody edge that calmed me without making a show of it.



I liked it.


And I was starting to like the hug, too.


It was just beginning to feel cozy until Ashton opened his mouth.


"Still too stiff. If you're this awkward with me when no one else is around, you'll never fool the people at the party."

###Chapter 69 Trust Issues	1200 Excuse me?
I thought I'd already relaxed enough.


If I were any more relaxed, I'd be in a bloody coma.


What was wrong with the hug? Not intimate enough?


I tightened my arms around him like I was trying to crack his ribs, then buried my face deeper into his chest.



And accidentally breathed right into his pec.


His shirt warmed up instantly.


Fantastic. Now my embarrassment had body heat.


He spoke again, low and close: "You're standing too straight. Too stiff. And the way your arms are locked around me... it feels like you're trying to arrest me,not hug me. Maybe we should try sitting down."


My mouth twitched.


Pretty sure that was the first performance reviewv I'd ever gotten on a hug.
And yeah, it didn't exactly earn five stars.


I rolled up my sleeves, channeled my inner overachiever, and marched to the sofa.


Ashton was already seated.


I leaned in, flung my arms around his neck. "That good enough for you?"


He patted my arm. "Feels like there's still room for the Michelin Man between us."



Right. Because apparently bending like a folding chair-arms looped around his neck, torso angled halfway to Narnia-wasn't the picture of intimacy he had in mind.



I recoiled and leaned back in again, this time trying to press my chest against him.


Sort of.


Unfortunately, my legs wanted no part of the effort.


So I stood there like a decapitated Barbie, upper body engaged, lower body on strike.
And my thighs were beginning to scream bloody murder.



I peeled off him. "Maybe we call it a night?"


"No. We don't have a lot of time. And this isn't going to fool anyone."


I stared at him. "It's your grandfather's eightieth. It's not like we'll be expected to make out in front of the cake."



"No, but we're also not supposed to look like the honeymoon's long over and we're already lawyering up for the divorce."


"That's what my hug looked like?"


Ashton nodded. "We could get Geoffrey or the staff in here to give feedback,if you want."


"No!" Absolutely not.


But the man had a point.


He'd been nothing but patient with me-hadn't asked for anything but this: a simple, convincing appearance at his grandfather's party


And I kind of needed him to return the favor with my parents.


So,yeah. The fake intimacy thing had to look real.


"Screw it," I muttered, then hiked a leg over and straddled him. "How's this?"



His mouth curled against my temple, just enough for me to feel it.



He wrapped an arm around my waist and tugged me closer. "That'll do."


I breathed out.



If that didn't satisfy him, I was officially out of ideas.


"Sometimes intimacy isn't about physical space or contact," he murmured. "It's about trust. You've got to trust me completely."



"Mm." I gave him the world's most non-committal grunt.He was right, of course.


But knowing something's right and doing it are two very different things.


It reminded me of this game we used to play at summer camp, some team-building trust exercise.


The coach made us line up in pairs.


First row would fall backward without looking, and the row behind was supposed to catch them.


Simple.


Terrifying.


I couldn't do it.



Not even after ages of mental prep.


The girl behind me was one of my best friends, and still, I froze.


What if she blinked and missed?


What if she secretly hated me and this was the perfect chance to let me crash to the ground?
What if she wanted to prank me and pretended to let me fall before catching me last minute?


The more | thought, the more my body locked up.


And this, sitting here with Ashton, somehow,it brought that whole memory screaming back.


Except now, I wasn't even facing away.


I was straddling him.


He couldn't let me fall.



But some irrational part of me whispered: what if he suddenly stood up?


What if I hit the floor? Cracked my head on the coffee table?



I squeezed my eyes shut and told my brain to shut the hell up.


I knew I had trust issues.


I knew Ashton wasn't wrong.


Still didn't mean I could magically flip a switch.
Five minutes passed.


Or five years.


I mumbled into his neck, "Can I get up now?"


"Not yet."


So we stayed there.


He stroked my back gently; he could tell I was still wired tight.


And the longer I stayed, the stiffer I got, untilmy legs felt like tree trunks and a crick started forming in my neck.


Finally, he said, "That's enough for today. We'll pick it up tomorrow."


"Great!" I launched off him like a spring. "I'm going upstairs. Night."
###Chapter 70 Kiss Rehearsal

The next night, we started the rehearsal over dinner.


Ashton sent the staff away at my insistence.


Then, instead of sitting across from me as usual,he slid into the seat beside me, like we were already at his grandfather's party, pretending to be the happy couple.


He pointed out where people would be sitting, who l needed to watch, which uncle pretended to be vegetarian to impress his green-juice-obsessed wife but secretly devoured steaks like a cave troll,and which one nearly blew up a construction site because-get this-he thought a pile of dynamite looked 'fun'.



Also, there was a cousin who might come for my throat because Ashton had apparently gotten her arrested for reckless driving


It was the most he'd talked to me since this whole thing started.


And even though his tone was dry and matter-of-fact, the stuff he said was... weirdly funny.


I found myself relaxing and even occasionally laughing.





The rehearsal continued after dinner.



By then, I'd accepted my fate.


It was just hugging,right?


Except this time, Ashton upped the difficulty-front hug, side hug, handshakes, air kisses, that dramatic couple's entrance where I had to hook my arm through his and glide in like we hadn't been awkward strangers a week ago.


And the weirdest part was, it started feeling...normal.




Like,dangerously normal.
Like muscle memory was kicking in.


So much so that when we sat down to take a break, l kind of... passed out.


Yeah.Dead serious. I fell asleep.


On him.


Full-on napping, face smooshed against his shoulder,legs curled up, drooling-on-his-shirt kind of passed out.



I blamed the wine.


When I finally woke up and looked at the wall clock,it was past ten.


Which meant I'd been out for nearly two bloody hours.




I sat up so fast I nearly gave myself whiplash.


My hair was a mess.


My brain was scrambled eggs.


And I'd just spent two whole hours unconscious in Ashton's arms, like some love-struck romcom extra.


Kill me now.


What was worse-he'd let me.


He'd just sat there. For two hours.



Letting me sleep on him.


Like we were... that kind of couple.


Nope. Absolutely not.


I swatted those thoughts away like mosquitoes on a humid night.


I sat up properly, fingers running through my tragic bedhead. "Think we're good for today?"


"Yeah." He leaned back. "We'll run it again tomorrow.Daily practice until we meet my grandfather, if that's okay with you."


"Cool," I mumbled, pretending I wasn't still mentally screaming into the void.


The way the Laurents operated, I wouldn't be shocked if they held family dinners with lie detectors under the placemats.


Ashton being the (rumored) bastard son probably made him a walking target.


No wonder he was so... calculated.


I stood up. "So... dinner and hugs again tomorrow?"


I was thinking maybe we should rehearse talking points instead.


Maybe a family cheat sheet, names, ranks,shareholding charts...


"No. Tomorrow we rehearse the kiss."



I froze. Turned slowly.


"Kiss," I echoed, incredulous. "As in, kiss kiss?"


"Yes," he said.



I blinked. "You mean like... an air kiss?" Hopefully.


"Do couples air kiss?" he countered. "They do if they're in France."


He quirked a brow. "Are you sure the French are only air-kissing and not, say... French kissing?"


My soul flatlined.


"We're not actually going to French kiss in front of your grandpa, are we? What if he has a stroke?"


Ashton smiled. Just a little, which somehow made it worse. "No French. Just a kiss. The kind couples do when they're dating."


Yeah, no big deal.


Just my mouth.


On his.


In front of an ailing patriarch and a family full of snoops.


Casual.



"You're not joking?" | asked, even though I already knew the answer.

"I'm not."



I opened my mouth.


Closed it.



Tried again.


I probably looked like a dying goldfish on land.


"My cousin tried something similar," he said. "Hired a girl to play the girlfriend. It was Christmas Eve, the whole family was there. They fooled no one. His mum cut off his allowance for three years. Until he brought home a real girlfriend."



I stared. "Wait-seriously?"


He gave me the 'l'm-a-man-of-facts' look. "Do I look likeI lie for fun?"



No. He looked like he filed lawsuits for fun.


But that was beside the point.


My brain whirred like an overheating hard drive.


If someone saw through us, would Ashton get hit  with the same treatment?



He didn't exactly strike me as the type to take criticism lying down, let alone roll over for a punishment.


Still. I'd promised I'd cooperate.


While I was still standing there like someone had brained me with a frying pan, Ashton got up from the sofa like he hadn't just casually drop-kicked my sanity.


He brushed past me on his way upstairs and tossed over his shoulder, "I'll be home early tomorrow."


Then he disappeared around the landing.


I stood there in the middle of the silent living room.


My legs finally gave a sad little twitch of protest, so l dragged myself upstairs and faceplanted onto the massive bed.



As soon as I shut my eyes, the word 'kiss' started doing naked cartwheels across my mental sky I must've fallen asleep somewhere between shame and denial, because the dream that hit was straight-up X-rated.



I was flat on my back, pinned to a leather sofa I didn't recognize.


Someone was kissing the breath out of me-hot,messy, and way too real.


My skin felt like it had been cranked up to lava and my brain had noped out entirely.


I tried to push him off, but every time I squirmed, he just followed.



The room was blurry.


The world didn't exist outside of that touch, that mouth,those hands.


I couldn't see his face, but everything in me screamed I knew himn..


My body did, anyway-my heart was too busy having a meltdown.
Then, just before dawn, the dream finally gave me a name to go with the body.


Ashton Laurent.


I jolted awake like I'd been tasered.


"Nope," I muttered, slapping my cheeks to manually reboot my system.


I grabbed my phone-7:30 a.m.


Countdown to kissing practice had officially begun.


Nope nope nope.


I needed a plan.


Preferably one that involved not being within ten meters of Ashton's mouth.



Time to make a run for it.
###Chapter 71 Ashton's POV: Tactical Retreat

The CEO's office was silent except for the knock on the door.



Dominic Everett stepped in, carrying a folder thick enough to strangle someone with. "Mr. Laurent, this is everything on Nyx Collective."



He placed it on the desk.


Ashton picked up the folder, flipping through it without a word.



With each page, his jaw set a little tighter.


By the time he reached the middle, the muscle under his cheekbone was pulsing.


So that was what Mirabelle had been dealing with.


Petty backstabbing.
Being undercut by her own team.


Screamed at in meetings by people who couldn't even carry her shoes.


"Fucking hell," he muttered.


He leaned back in his chair, report still in hand, his fingers tapping against one name.


"This Rexford Caldwell-why does that sound familiar?"





"He runs Titan Growth Fund, which invests in Nyx Collective, but he's not involved in the studio's day-to-day running. He asked to meet you last week,but your schedule was full."


"Right." Ashton rubbed his chin. The name clicked now, "Tell him I'll make time. Set it up."


"Yes,sir."


Once Dominic left, Ashton reopened the folder,slower this time.


The report was more thorough than what Cassian had been able to find out from Yvaine.



According to the last section, some C-list actress was having custom jewelry made for a film festival in Italy, and that had started the whole row.


He pulled out his phone and made a call.


"The Venice Film Festival next month. Are you going?"





The voice on the other end perked up instantly. courselam.Why?"


"Are you wearing jewelry?"


"Duh. I'm planning to kill it on the red carpet. The dress and the set are both exclusive pre-season drops from-wait for it-Amarante. I'm the first celeb to wear them."



"Return the jewelry. You're wearing mine."


"What?" She actually yelled. "Since when do you make jewelry?"


"I don't. My wife does. You'll wear her design."
Silence. Long enough that he thought the line had dropped.
Then, "Ashton Laurent. Are you out of your mind? Or is this some kind of practical joke?"
"No. Let's do dinner. I'll introduce you."
He hung up before she could argue.
***

10:03 p.m.
Still no sign of her.

Ashton hadn't moved from the sofa.

He'd eaten dinner alone-half a steak, three bites of salad, and enough scotch to strip varnish.
She'd texted him at six, chirpy as hell: [Out wvith Yvaine.Might be back late!]
Back late, his arse.

Mirabelle didn't just 'casually' go for drinks. She didn't do 'casual' anything.


He knew a tactical retreat when he saw one.


So he'd sent Cassian.



The bastard reported back with confirmation.


"She invited Yvaine. Not the other way around."


Right. So it was a retreat. Dressed up as a girls' night out.



He'd waited anyway.


Like an idiot.


And waited some more.


Then, "Get Carlisle out of there," Ashton barked into the phone. "I want Mirabelle back. Now."①


Cassian let out a laugh that sounded more like a choke. "Mate. You two are insane. I'm not your goddamn messenger boy. If she wants to stay out, let her."


Click. Ashton tossed the phone aside.



He stared at the time again.



10:08 p.m.



So she was dodging the rehearsal?



Fine.



But there was another possibility.



A worse one.



Had she found out about the lie?



There was no cousin.



No tragic tale of the poor bloke dragging his hired girlfriend to a family Christmas dinner.


That was a story concocted entirely for Mirabelle's benefit.



But she had no links to his family.


No way she could've found out.
This sudden night out was more likely just her way of saying no to the kiss.


But no, Ashton wasn't going to let her off the hook that easily, not after the kind of night he'd had.


He hadn't slept.


Not properly.


Every time he closed his eyes, it was like being sucked back into that sofa.


Her breath warm against his chest.


Her laugh pressed under his skin.


Her legs tangled with his like they had every fucking right to be there.


In his dream, it didn't stop there.


First the sofa.



Then his bed.



Then the hotel room-the one he hadn't told her he'd bought after that night.
Dream-Mirabelle was straddling him again, like that night.


That single, scorching night she'd taken the lead and made him forget his own damn name.


But Dream-Ashton flipped her under him, just as fast.


She wrapped her arms around his back, gasped his name, pulled him closer like she didn't want him to leave.


And in the dream, he didn't.


He drove himself into her like he had no brakes,and she clung to him like she wanted him to ruin her.


He woke up pissed off and hard.


The duvet got kicked to the floor.


Sweat glued his skin to the sheets.



Two glasses of freezing water did nothing to cool him down.



He ended up in the kitchen, shirtless, hair a wreck,
glaring at the marble counter like it owed him an apology


Still hard.


Still furious.


Still thinking about her.


If he wasn't going to get peace, then neither was she.





Ashton called the bar.


The Cider & Smoke was closing early tonight-health code violation, staff emergency, gas leak; the manager could pick a story.


Ashton didn't care.


He just wanted her out of there.


Thirty minutes later, he heard the crunch of tires on gravel.


Geoffrey poked his head into the living room.Laurent? Mrs. Laurent's back. Talking to the driver.
Should be inside any second."



"Mm." Ashton didn't glance up.


His eyes stayed on the tablet.


One hand flicked the screen like he was reading something important.



He wasn't.



He'd been scrolling the same page for the last twenty minutes.



But Geoffrey wasn't stupid.


He saw the way Ashton sat up straighter.


The way his fingers smoothed the wrinkle out of his shirt like he hadn't been sitting there all night,simmering in silence.


The shift was small.


But it was there.



Geoffrey said nothing.
He just slipped away, because he wasn't an idiot.
###Chapter 72 Instructional Video
I walked in a minute later, tipsy, still giggling at some dumb meme Yvaine had just sent me. Something about a guy trying to deep-throat a corn dog and nearly dying forit-quality content.


I hadn't thought Ashton would still be awake.Definitely hadn't expected him to be sitting dead center in the living room like some kind of final boss,staring straight at the door.


Our eyes met. Shit.


My grin froze. I snapped my phone shut too hard and wobbled sideways, pressing my fingers to my temples.


"Drank way too much," I mumbled."Gonna crash.Nightttt..."


I staggered like my knees had melted, clinging to the banister like it owed me rent. Giving him a wide berth, I dragged my feet upstairs, feeling his gaze right up my spine.


Don't look back.



Don't trip.


Don't break character.



The second I made it to the bedroom, I shut the door behind me like I'd just outrun a serial killer.



I jumped straight into the shower and let the water blast me.



"Damn it." I thudded my forehead against the ceramic tile, while a mental porno featuring Ashton played on a loop.


Thanks,Yvaine,



We'd met up earlier and she'd picked up right where she'd left off at her birthday, as if no time had passed. Apparently, my 'married life' was now her favorite drama.
She grilled me like I was on trial for Crimes Against Horniness, cross-examining me over every single sexless second I'd spent under the same roof as Ashton.


I told her we hadn't slept together.


Well. Not since that one time in the hotel room, pre-fake-marriage, pre-everything. So technically, it didn't count.Right?


She gave me a look like I'd just told her I enjoyed beige wallpaper and abstinence. "What the hell's wrong with you? You sleep next to that and don't tap it? Where's your libido? Menopause hit early or what?"



"I don't sleep next to him," I corrected her. "And my libido's doing just fine, thanks."


She rolled her eyes. "Yeah, clearly. Thnat's why you're living with a guy who looks like sin on legs and not riding him like a stolen bike. I'd be on him every morning before coffee and again after dinner, just for the cardio."
"I'm not you, Yvaine. And it's all fake, remember?"


"Fake marriage doesn't mean fake orgasms. If you met him under normal circumstances, you'd have nailed him, admit it."


"Yeah,I would."


And,technically, I had.


"So what's stopping you now?"


"I don't want to make things more complicated."


"You overthink everything. Mira, babe, I love you like family, but you're a damn coward. You move slower than-what's a slow-ass animal?"


"Tortoise?"


"Yeah. Slower than a constipated tortoise. Look, life's short.You admit you like him,right?"


"'Like' is a stretch-"


"Fine, you like his body?"


"Well, yeah. I mean, I have eyes."
"You emotionally tangled up with anyone else?"


"No."


"And he's not either?"


"I haven't asked him."


"That means no. So what the fuck are you waiting for? Go home, yank his trousers down, and ride him like a champion. And if you're feeling rusty, I've got a few instructional videos-"



That was when the pub's PA crackled on with an apologetic, "We're closing early tonight."


Now I was out of the shower, in an oversized T-shirt,flopped on the bed like a regret-flavored pancake.


"Damn you, Yvaine," I muttered, dragging a pillow over my face."Could've at least airdropped me the vid."



Too late. My brain had already started shooting its own movie. And Ashton was the star.



I almost screamed when there was a knock at my door.
"Mrs. Laurent," Carmen called gently. "'You probably need hydration. I've brought you some lemon and honey in warm water, and Advil if you've got a headache.May I come in?"
I blinked away the X-rated image. "Thanks, Carmen.Door's open."
Except when it swung open, it wasn't Carmen standing there.

Ashton took the tray from her hands and strolled into my room.

I stared at him. He stared back.

And then-like some divine slapstick punishment-my phone slipped and smacked me in the face.
"Fuck," I muttered, rubbing my cheek. Great. A black eye to go with the slow.death of my dignity.
"Um, thank you. Can you just put the tray on the nightstand? I'll drink it in a bit."
No reply.



I turned, slowly.


He was still there. Still staring. Standing two paces from my bed. He said nothing.


I rolled over and buried my face in the duvet likean ostrich. "Ugh, migraine. So tired. Gonna pass out.Bye."


Please leave, please leave, please get the hell out.


I lay there, holding my breath as if I were auditioning to be a corpse.



I heard the quiet clink of the tray hitting the nightstand. But no footsteps walking away. Just an awful silence.



My heart was beating so hard I could hear it in my ears. Every second dragged like a horror film jump scare that never came..


Nearly suffocating, I poked my head out and risked a peek.
The wardrobe mirror caught his reflection. His eyes were lowered, his gaze fixed somewhere on my back.And I was suddenly very aware that I was wearing only a T-shirt. No bra, no panties. And the shirt had ridden up when I'd jumped into bed, the hem now somewhere mid-cheek. Where his eyes were.

He wasn't moving. Just watching. Just standing there and staring at me like he had nothing better to do than mentally strip me.
And I couldn't fix my shirt without admitting that l knew he was looking. That I cared.
So I just played dead. A half-naked, very humiliated corpse.
Then, after what felt like a decade, he moved.I tensed like a cat about to bolt, but all he did was step forward, lean down, and gently pull the blanket up over me.
He tucked it around me like I was five and not actively dying of embarrassment.
"Good night," he murmured.


Then he was gone.


I groaned into the pillow.
 ###Chapter 73 Lip-lock

Next morning, I got up before sunrise, feeling like a guilt-ridden teenager after sneaking out.


There was no way Ashton hadn't noticed my entire performance last night, and I was not about to sit across from him at breakfast pretending | was a normal, functional human being.


So yeah,I tried to sneak out.


Tiptoed downstairs, shoes in hand, bag swinging at my side.


But guess what?



He was already there.


Sitting on the sofa like the king of the business world.


Watching the news.



Calm.
Shirt sleeves rolled up like a casual threat.


I nearly threw my handbag at his face.


"You're up early," | accused.


He glanced over, expressionless. "Where are you going this early?"


Busted.



I bit my lip, attempting that fake innocence that only works on men who want to believe the lie. "Yvaine wanted to do breakfast. I'm just gonna...yeah,head out..."



I edged toward the door.



Then, just as my fingers brushed the handle-


"Aren't you forgetting something?"


My heart plummeted straight into my shoes.



I froze.



Turned.
Marched right back across the room like I hadn't just been tiptoeing a second ago.


And then I climbed into his lap.


Straddled him, arms wrapped around his neck.


No hesitation.


Well, maybe a little hesitation.


But mostly flair.


Kissing was off-limits.


But hugging-I could do that blindfolded and drunk.


I leaned in, brushing my cheek against his neck,whisper-close to his ear.


"This is as far as I can go. For now. As for the other thing... maybe give me some time? I need time to mentally prepare. You're a man of action, but I'm a girl with nerves. I need a heads-up before we go full lip-lock."


I needed enough time to brush my teeth, drown myself in breath spray, and eat a hundred mints.


More importantly, I needed time to warn myself not to shove my tongue down his throat or do something wildly inappropriate and irreversible.



Ashton froze.



He literally stopped breathing.


His body stiffened, like someone had swapped his spine for an ironing board.


He just sat there, silent.



Was he angry?


Or disappointed?



Or silently going over our ironclad contract,searching for a clause that said, "If fake wife misbehaves, fake husband gets to unleash legal hellfire"?



I decided not to provoke him further. "Let's leave it at this for today, yeah?"
He exhaled. His voice was low and rough. "We'll talk tonight."


"Cool, cool." I bounced off his lap.


Then I noticed him looking at me strangely.


I squinted back at him.


Was his neck...red?


Like, sunburn-at-midnight red.


For a split second, I wondered if I'd given him a love bite without realizing, but unless I'd started sucking necks in my sleep, that wasn't it.



"Are you-?" | was about to ask if he was allergic to my lip gloss when Carmen popped her head in.


"Mr. Laurent, Mrs. Laurent, breakfast's ready." She gave me a sunny smile. "Mrs. Laurent, I made that spicy chorizo scramble you like so much."


"Thanks,Carmen."


I glanced longingly at the dining room.

Then at the door.



Then at Ashton.


His lips curved. "Thought you had a breakfast date with Yvaine?"



"It could also be a lunch date," I said."Or afternoon tea. Yvaine's very flexible."


He stood. "Let's eat."



I backed into the dining room.


Last night I'd been so hungry I almost raided the pantry, but I stayed in bed like a good little fake-drunk idiot to avoid blowing my cover.


Now I was starving.


I sat down.



Ashton tore a freshly toasted baguette in half and handed me one.



I slathered mine with strawberry jam and pushed the jar of paté toward him without thinking.
And then it hit me.



Not the food.



The domesticity.


The fact that this whole stupid, cozy, married-for-show breakfast ritual was starting to feel normal.


Like | knew exactly how he liked his coffee.


Like he knew I put jam on everything.


Like we were just another boring couple havng breakfast-not two liars trapped in a high-stakes fake marriage.


And that freaked me out way more than kissing him ever could.



***



After breakfast, I locked myself in the study to work on BloomState drafts.



Geoffrey had cleared out the roomn just for me, and I'd never been this productive in my life.
Even at Nyx Collective, with every professional tool and software available, I hadn't worked this fast.


Sometime in the evening, Ashton texted to say he wouldn't be home for dinner.


I let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding.


Then he walked through the front door twenty minutes later.


Apparently, 'not home for dinner' didn't mean 'not home at all.



Thanks for the clarity, CEO of Misleading Messages.


I was in the kitchen sipping water when I heard the door click open.


My fight-or-flight response kicked in.


I picked flight.


Slipping past the island, I tiptoed toward the stairs like a cartoon burglar.



And then I saw him.
Ashton was sprawled across the sofa like a GQ centerfold-legs crossed, shirt slightly undone.


His eyes were locked on me.


I scratched my chin and forced a grin. "Uh... long day? You should go to bed early. Beauty sleep and all that."



His right hand dangled lazily over the armrest.


Then his index finger lifted, curling at me like he was beckoning a pet."Come here."


I should have said no.



Should have kept walking.



I didn't.



My feet moved.



One step.



Two.



This morning I'd noticed how soft his lips looked.
Thin, precise, probably very kissable.


A kiss wouldn't kill me.


After all, I was getting paid.


Two million sat in my bank account-that was enough motivation to treat him like a hot check with abs.


I picked up the pace and dropped myself onto his lap, like I did this every Tuesday.


Ashton blinked.



Clearly, this was not what he expected.


"I said come here. I didn't say do anything."


I wrapped my arms around his neck.


"Come on. We both know what 'come here' means with you. Let's just get the rehearsal over with. I've got sketches to finish."
###Chapter 74 Mexican Standoff
Ashton's jaw clenched so hard I thought he might chip a molar.


One of his hands twitched, like he was dying to grab me but was trying to play it cool.


I stared at him.



He stared back.



Neither of us blinked.



It was a Mexican standoff, except no one had a gun.


The lights had dimmed-had they always been that low?



His stupid smart home probably detected horniness and adjusted the mood lighting.



I could feel my heartbeat pounding in my ears,my chest pressed to his.


He wasn't saying a word.


Neither was l.


We were both waiting for the other to make a move first.



Pride's a bitch like that.



Then-fine.I cracked first.



I shut my eyes, leaned in, lips inches from his, my breath ghosting across his skin-


His phone rang.


I jerked back.



Sat up ramrod straight. "Um,your phone."


He exhaled like he wanted to strangle someone.

"Ignore it."


It rang again.


And again.

He stabbed the screen to hang up, but whoever it was had octopus fingers.


The call came back instantly.


I glimpsed the name-Cassian Langford.


"Might wanna pick up," I muttered, sliding off his lap and onto the other end of the sofa. "If he's calling this late, it's probably something important."


I crossed my legs, leaned back, and grabbed a throw pillow, as if it could absorb the residual heat.


It couldn't.



Ashton looked like he wanted to murder someone.


He stabbed 'Answer.' "This better be life-and-death urgent or I'm blocking you for life."


Then his expression shifted from murder-mode to tight-lipped concern in record time.


"Yeah. Got it. On my way now."


He didn't even wait to hang up before he was shrugging into his coat and heading for the door.


"Something came up. I've got to handle it. Might not be back tonight."


"Right. Go. Drive safe." I jumped up too fast,smacked my knee on the coffee table, and pretended I didn't.



His footsteps were already fading down the hallway.


I didn't catch what Cassian said, but judging by Ashton's face, it wasn't just a broken printer or someone crying over a spreadsheet.


Once the tail lights vanished down the driveway,I closed the door and pressed my burning cheek against the cool wood. "Saved by the bell."


Cassian's call had come just in time.


Kissing Ashton shouldn't have been a big deal-in theory.


But in reality, I was suffering from sweaty palms,shaky hands, and a near brush with actually catching

 feelings.


If we hadn't been interrupted right then, Ashton was about to find out I was the world's worst kisser.



***



The next day, I holed up in the study, sketching design mock-ups and trying not to keep checking my phone every five seconds.


Ashton didn't come home last night.


I finally caved at lunch and texted him.


No reply.


By 5 pm, still nothing.


Either the world had ended or he was knee-deep in something ugly.


Probably both.


Then my screen lit up.


[Don't worry, I'm fine. Dinner tonight. Want you to meet someone. I'll pick you up in an hour.]
I replied:[Cool.]


Then I dashed to my bedroom.


When I say I spent twenty minutes in front of the wardrobe debating between 'business trophy wife'and 'don't-fuck-with-me chic', I mean it.


There were more clothes in the closet than I could ever figure out what to do with.


I picked a high-neck column dress-long, slinky,classy, and just tight enough to make men pause mid-sentence.


The kind of dress that said, "Yes, I've got a brain, but don't think for a second I'm not aware of my ass."


Hair slicked back in a neat twist, face done up just enough to show I'd made an effort,I checked myself in the mirror and gave a nod.


Wouldn't embarrass Ashton.



Probably.


At six-thirty on the dot, a black Maybach rolled up.
Ashton was in the back seat when the driver opened the door for me.



I slid in, smoothed my skirt over my thighs, and caught him staring.


His eyes dipped, sharp and shameless.



Lingering.



Assessing.


I knew that look.



That was "calculating the probability of ripping this dress off in a private booth" energy.


Except, his jaw twitched, and he dragged his gaze back to my face.


"You look... nice tonight," he muttered.


I turned my head and gave him a smile, as if I hadn't noticed him nearly combusting across from me.


Then I tilted just enough so he could catch the glint of the Harry Winstons in my ears.
"Wore the earrings you gave me," I said. "I haven't thanked you for them. The design's exquisite."


"You're welcome." His voice was lower this time."They look perfect on you."


I wanted to throw a compliment back, but what the hell was I supposed to say?


That he looked nice?



Obviously.


The man wore a suit like it was tailored to his DNA.



And his face didn't need jewelry or makeup to sharpen its features-it came pre-sculpted.


So I went with, "You look tired. Something happen at work?"


And then immediately regretted it.


Genius conversationalist, Mira. Really killing it.


He nodded. "Rebel attacks in the Red Sea. Some of our ships had to be rerouted." Then he added, "Don't worry, it's handled."



And that killed the husband-and-wife talk.



The car pulled up outside one of those discreet,old-money restaurants that pretended to be low-key by charging four hundred dollars for a plate of air.


Ashton took my hand and led me upstairs.


"So, who are we meeting?" I asked. "Business partner? A Laurent relative?"



"You'll see."



Yeah. That didn't feel ominous at all.



I took a breath and gave myself the usual pep talk.



It's fine.



Smile, nod, pretend to be the arm candy.


No one can kill you if you look hot enough.


Then Ashton opened the door.



I paused mid-stride.
Sitting in the booth, legs elegantly crossed, was none other than Octavia Grey.
###Chapter 75 Throuple
She was sitting like she'd been poured into the seat,legs crossed, posture casual, her face so absurdly perfect it made me want to toss my entire skincare routine in the bin.


I knew that face.


Everyone did.


She was the Octavia-film awards, designer perfume campaigns, the kind of actress who could cry in a close-up and make the whole cinema sob.


I'd watched her latest film three times and still hadn't forgiven her for dying beautifully in the rain.


In person, she looked even more impossibly flawless.


Like someone had photoshopped her into real life without asking the rest of us for permission.


I walked in behind Ashton, mny legs moving on autopilot, and slid into the seat across from her.



She smiled.



I smiled.



It was all very polite and awkward.


I had no idea what the hell was going on.


The last time I'd been anywhere near LGH, Dominic had let slip that Octavia was pursuing Ashton.



Which apparently included dates.


Romantic ones.⑪



So now my options were:



A) Ashton had gone completely insane and decided to introduce me to his almost-girlfriend like we were in some weird throuple drama.



B) He was dumping me. In a restaurant. In front of Octavia Grey.



That would be a bold move.
Or was this some twisted arrangement where I got to meet the real woman in his life-while I played the decorative spouse for legal convenience?


My shoulders tensed.


Every trashy soap twist I'd ever half-watched started queuing up in my head like a playlist from hell.


Then Ashton rested his hand briefly on mine. "This is my wife,Mirabelle Vance. And this is Octavia Grey."


Octavia held out her hand. "Lovely to meet you."


I took it, still half waiting for someone to shout"C∪t.""Hi. I've seen your work. You're even more gorgeous offscreen."



"Thank you."


Her smile was easy. Friendly.


Not a single trace of competition or possession in her eyes.


The smile took the edge off.
Not completely, but enough that I didn't feel like l needed to throw my drink in someone's face.


Yet.


She looked exactly like she did in the films-only now l could see the tiny mole near her left ear and the way her lashes curled at the tips without mascara.


But what threw me was her vibe.



The press always painted her as some frosty diva who'd send back bottled water for being too wet.



But the woman in front of me was warm, open, and totally lacking the catty energy I'd braced for.


And judging by the cozy familiarity but zero chemistry between her and Ashton, I'd definitely overthought the whole he's-about-to-dump-me-for-an-actress situation.


Once the food arrived, Ashton cleared his throat.


"Mirabelle, she's got a favor to ask," he said, nodding toward Octavia.
"Me?" I jabbed my thumb at my chest. "You sure you've got the right Mira?"


Ashton gave Octavia a look.



She leaned in, smiling like we were besties at brunch."Ash mnentioned you're a jewelry designer?"



"Yes."



"Well, I'm flying out to the Venice International Film Festival in a few days, and I still haven't locked in my jewelry. The big brands all sent stuff, but it's the same old shiny crap. I wanted something different.Something custom." She paused. "So... Miss Vance,I was wondering if you'd be interested?"



Ashton coughed.


Octavia's eyes flicked to him, then she caught herself and corrected with a laugh, "Sorry-Mrs.Laurent, would you be interested?"


She gave Ashton a sideways glance, like she was checking if she'd passed the test.
He gave a tiny nod.


I blinked at her, completely floored.


Me? Designing for Octavia Grey?


She could snap her fingers and have Cartier groveling at her feet.


And here she was, asking me to do her red carpet jewelry?


And she wasn't going to just any film fest-she was going to that one.


The Venice gig.


The same one where Eliza Black, our current Nyx Collective obsession, was making her big splash.


We'd practically turned the office into a shrine for that project.



But Octavia was a different league.


The kind of star who was the headline.



Anything she wore would be dissected, reposted,
sold out, memed.


I opened my mouth.



Nothing came out.



"Time's tight," she went on. "Every designer I've worked with said no. Too risky, too rushed. But if you're up for it...?"


"Yes!" I blurted, a bit too loudly.


Octavia's smile widened. "Fabulous. It's a mad timeline though, so I'm afraid you'll be pulling some very ugly hours."


"That's fine! I've got a half-finished design set that might work-l can push to wrap it up, source the materials in parallel, and start production straight away. We'll make it in time."


She nodded like she was impressed. "Perfect. But I'll need to see the designs first. If I don't love them, l'd rather hit the carpet in bare ears and a naked neckline. I'm not wearing anything meh."
"Got it. I'll send you the sketches tonight as soon as l get home."


"Deal."



We spent a few more minutes discussing details, and by the time we exchanged contact info,I was pretty sure I was floating two inches off my chair.


It felt weirdly like meeting a childhood pop idol-only this one drank sparkling water and might wear my jewelry on a red carpet streamed to millions.


At some point, Ashton ducked out to take a call,leaving me alone in the room with her.


Octavia glanced over, sipping her drink. "You kept looking at me. Then at Ashton. Then at me again.Everything alright?"


I choked on air.


She raised a brow, clearly enjoying this.


Okay, fine, I had been looking.


Trying to figure out if she was secretly eye-banging Ashton under the table.
###Chapter 76 Sell the Act

Verdict: she wasn't.


I gave her a sheepish smile, cheeks burning like I'd swallowed a radiator.


I thought I'd been subtle.


Apparently not.


Octavia laughed, a silvery sound. "You thought Ash and I were a thing, didn't you?"


I groaned. "Yeah... I might've read that whole situation completely wrong. Sorry, that was just me being dumb."


She grinned. "Don't worry, you're not the first woman to assume that. But trust me-he's all yours. Ash and I are related."


"You are?" | tried to recall if I'd noticed any resemblance in their features, but came up empty;

 after all, didn't all beautiful people sort of look alike?


"I'm a distant cousin on his mum's side. We weren't close growing up, only started reconnecting a few years ago."


So Dominic Everett had been chatting shit?


Or maybe I'd messed up the name?


Was there another actress he'd been gossiping about?





Before | could untangle that mess, Octavia continued, "It's obvious he really likes you. I'm happy for him, honestly. Took him long enough to find someone he actually wants to marry."


She gave me this look-warm and kind and a little nostalgic. "Ashton was... difficult as a kid. Bit of a loner. For the longest time, I didn't think he'd ever settle down."


She didn't elaborate, and I didn't press.


It didn't seem right to dig into Ashton's childhood when we were out here lying to half of Skyline City.


And as for her comment about him liking me?


I had no bloody idea where she was getting that from.


Still, I pasted on my best bashful smile.


Octavia studied me.


Then she leaned in across the table, eyes gleaming.


"Come here. I've got a secret for you."


I leaned in without thinking,totally hooked.


She cupped one hand around her mouth and whispered into my ear, "I'm actually married. Two kids. So you don't have to worry about me and your husband getting too cosy."


My jaw dropped so fast it nearly cracked the floor.


I just stared at her, blinking like a malfunctioning android.



Octavia Grey-the goddess of the screen, everyone's favourite unattainable icon-wasn't just taken.


She had kids. Plural.


She'd never gone around shouting about being single, but no one had ever mentioned a husband,let alone tiny humans she'd birthed.


The woman had been on every screen and billboard since I was fifteen.


When the hell did she have time to grow humans?


She raised one finger to her lips like we were co-conspirators. "You've got to keep this between us,okay?"


"Yeah... of course." I nodded like a dazed puppy, then blurted out, "Can I get your autograph?"


Smooth.Real smooth.


But Yvaine would've killed me if I didn't ask.


Octavia laughed. "How many do you want? I'll sign 'em all."
***



Dinner wrapped, and I climbed into Ashton's car for the ride back.



I was still halfway between impressed and scandalised about Octavia's mum-life reveal.


The entertainment industry was crawling with secrets, apparently.


On screen, she was the ice-queen CEO type.



In person?


Warm.Funny.Chill.


Meanwhile, Eliza Black, TV's favourite cupcake in heels, was about as cuddly as a parking warden in rush hour.



Somewhere between red lights, I remembered what Octavia had said earlier-that Ashton liked me.



I peeked sideways.


He was sitting to my right, silent, face unreadable as usual, eyes shadowed in the low lighting.


It almost looked as if he was napping, except his posture was anything but relaxed.



I dismissed Octavia's words.



Ashton wasn't in love.



At least not with me.



He had a precious ex stashed somewhere in his chest like a vintage wine no one else was allowed to touch.



Still... even if he didn't like me, not really, he'd been good to me.


That part I couldn't deny.


He'd been careful. Attentive. Almost gentle, in his own terrifying way.



I sneaked another peek.



My gaze stalled on that jawline.
He looked intense even when he wasn't supposed to be.



The man tackled everything with the same laser-focused,maddeningly sincere attention.


No wonder he'd climbed to the top of the billionaire food chain at an age when most people were still figuring out how not to drown in student loans.


Take our fake marriage, for instance.


He hadn't just planned it; he'd rehearsed it.


Scheduled sessions. Run-throughs. Bullet points.


At the time, I'd thought it was overkill, a kind of neurotic control-freak move.



But apparently it worked.


Octavia, an actress trained to lie for a living,hadn't suspected a thing.


Speaking of rehearsals...


There was still one scene we hadn't nailed.
I stole another glance at him.



Despite the polite two inches of distance between us, I could feel the heat radiating off his thighs.


Something in my lower belly fluttered-hot, reckless,and impossible to ignore.


I reached over and pressed a button.


The privacy screen between us and the driver slid up.


Ashton glanced at me, eyebrows drawing together.


I twisted my upper body so I was facing him.


"Thanks for bringing me to meet Octavia."


Then I leaned in.



One quick kiss. Just a soft press of lips to his cheek.


A second later, I was turning back to face front like it hadn't just happened.


The car was dark. Quiet.


But I could feel his stare.
When I dared look again, his eyes had gone low and dangerous, lit up with something wild and hungry.


"That's not the kind of kiss I want," he said.


"W-what kind of-"



Didn't finish the sentence.



Couldn't.



Ashton lunged at me.
###Chapter 77 The Kiss
Ashton's mouth crashed into mine with no preamble,no warning, no hesitation.


Hot, forceful, and absolutely unrelenting-he kissed like he owned my lips, my breath,my goddamn soul.


I gasped, trying to pull back, but he was already there, already taking.


His tongue pushed past the resistance of my lips like it had every right to be there, and maybe it did,because my body sure as hell wasn't protesting.


My hands shot up instinctively, palms flattening against his chest-but instead of pushing him away they curled, gripping the fabric of his shirt as if it were the only thing keeping me tethered.


"Ashton-wait, just-" | tried to speak, but all I managed was a breathless jumble against his mouth,broken by the sheer force of him.

He didn't wait.


With a smooth, dizzying motion, he wrapped one arm around my waist and hauled me into his lap.


The seat creaked beneath us, the whole car shifting slightly with the movement.


Darkness swallowed us, the only light a faint,flickering neon glow bleeding through the tinted windows, casting him in sharp edges and shadows.


I felt his thigh under mine-hard,hot,tense-and then l stopped feeling anything else, because he kissed me again, deeper this time, like he was staking a claim.


My legs straddled his lap awkwardly, knees pressing into the leather seat on either side of him.


I was on top, technically.


But somehow, that didn't mean anything.


He was the one in control.


Every flick of his tongue, every greedy pull of his lips made it clear: I wasn't running this show.
The air in the backseat thinned, my lungs burning,my skin prickling like someone had turned up the temperature by ten degrees.


The windows fogged.


My head swam.


Every nerve I had funneled into where we touched-his hands spanning my waist, fingers flexing like he was holding back from just tearing my clothes off;the press of his chest against mine, so firm it felt like being pinned beneath a wall.


And still he didn't stop.


I kissed him back because I couldn't not.


Because my body had already made the decision for me.


My lips moved with his, pliant, eager, like they belonged to someone else entirely.


I felt weightless and drunk, high on him.


He smelled like clean skin and woody cologne,but there was something darker beneath it, something addictive-salt and sweat and heat.



Time got weird.



I forgot how minutes worked.


I forgot the world outside the car even existed.


There was just him, just this, just the slick, obscene sound of our mouths clashing, and the low, hungry noise he made when I shifted slightly in his lap.


By the time he finally let me breathe, my legs were jelly, my lips bruised, and my whole body felt boneless.


I slumped against his chest, panting, one handstill fisted in his shirt like I couldn't bear to let go.


Ashton exhaled, slow, controlled, but I felt the tension in his thighs, the not-so-subtle press of something hard beneath me that made my skin flush all over again.


The driver coughed discreetly. "Mr. Laurent, we've arrived."



I shot off Ashton's lap like I'd touched a live wire.


He gave a low grunt, adjusted his suit jacket to hide the very obvious evidence of what had just happened-or almost happened-and stepped out of the car.


Then he reached back in and scooped me up.


I flailed, limbs everywhere. "Put me down-l can walk-"





"Can you?"


I tried.



I failed.



The moment my heels hit the ground, my knees buckled.



I wobbled sideways like a baby deer on ice, nearly twisting my ankle into a right-angled tragedy.


Ashton's arm shot out, catching me before I could fully embarrass myself.


Still dizzy-high, really-from that kiss for was it kisses? That series of escalating, breath-stealing,life-shortening assaults on my self-control),seriously considered letting him carry me inside.



But we weren't alone.


The driver was still there.


He was no doubt discreet-he worked for Ashton,after all-but I could practically feel the popcorn in his mental hand and the gossipy sparkle in his eyes.


I patted Ashton's arm to tell him I was fine and that he should let go.


The moment he did, I bolted into the house.


Behind me, I heard a low chuckle.



I scrambled up the stairs, half-limping, half-flying.


I just ran to my room and flung myself face-first onto the bed, pulling the blanket over my head.
My lips still tingled, swollen and slick, haunted by the memory of his mouth-demanding, consuming, like he was trying to suck the soul out of me.


And God help me, I'd let him.


I melted into him like butter on a hot skillet.


Yvaine's voice rang in my head: "Hot guy. No emotional baggage. Ride him like a stolen bike and get the glow-up your love life needs."


Maybe she had a point.


Maybe I'd been clinging too hard to an outdated model-emotions first, sex later.


With Rhys, it had been all longing gazes and high-minded ideals, like I was in love with the concept of him more than the man himself.


But this was different.



No strings, no expectations.


Just heat. Hunger. A one-year contract and a man who kissed like he wanted to rewrite my DNA.
Maybe it was time to reframe this whole fake marriage.





Call it what it really was: a one-year stand.


I propped myself up on both elbows and stared toward the door.


I didn't know what I was thinking.


Didn't know what I was expecting.


The bedroom door was unlocked.


Maybe he would...


My gaze lingered on the handle, half-daring it to move.





Half-terrified it might.
###Chapter 78 Ashton's POV: Interrupted
Ashton watched her bolt into the house, all flailing limbs and flushed cheeks.



He let out a short, low laugh.


Then he turned to Gino, who was still hovering by the car door. "Next time, don't drive so bloody fast."


The driver nodded."Yes,boss."



He didn't argue the obvious-that Ashton was usually the one barking at him to step on it.


He valued his job, and his kneecaps.


Ashton walked into the house, loosening his tie as he went.



The living room was quiet.


Mirabelle was already upstairs.
Probably in her bedroom.


Probably thinking about the kiss.



He was.



Ashton took the stairs two at a time.



Would her door be locked?


Would she open it if he knocked?


His mind was already undressing her again-he hadn't even taken off her shoes earlier, and the thought was driving him insane.



He quickened his pace, rounded the corner-



His phone buzzed.



Ashton froze mid-step, jaw tightening.


He yanked the phone out of his pocket, saw the name flash on the screen, then glanced back at her door.



Then down at the raging hard-on in his trousers.
He let out a muttered curse, turned on his heel, and stalked to the study.
The door slammed behind him hard enough to rattle the frame.
Inside, Ashton stood by the window, the overhead light catching the hard angles of his face.
He held the phone to his ear like he wanted to crush it."What."
"Where have you been? You've been dodging my calls all day," Reginald snapped. "The Harbourview District mess. What are you planning to do about it?And when are you planning on notifying the board?"
"Harbourview's not your concern," Ashton said."Stick to the branch office. You run Laurent City Estates,not LGH."
"Don't forget, I still hold shares in LGH. And Harbourview's a major deal. I told you and that Langford boy-both too green, too eager-that this would blow up in your faces. Now look. I heard the scaffolding collapsed in the wind and hit a guard. If even l've heard of it, half the city probably has by now. Are you trying to get us sued?"
Ashton's jaw flexed.
He thought of the hospital room.
Fluorescent lights buzzing.
The stench of antiseptic.
The dull beeping of machines doing what a broken body couldn't.
Ramon Vega-thirty-four, married, father of two-had taken the full weight of a twisted scaffold bar across the side of his skull.
Skull fracture. Internal bleeding. Coma.
No prognosis yet.
"It wasn't the wind," Ashton said evenly. "I was on-site within the hour. That frame didn't buckle from gusts. The welds gave out. Shit materials."
Someone had greased the wrong palm.
He'd known it the second he'd seen the bent beams.Steel like aluminum foil. Cracks running through weld seams like veins in dry clay.

No way it was up to code.
He and Cassian had pulled an all-nighter, elbows deep in supplier logs, invoices, shipping manifests.
"Half the structure would've crumbled if someone sneezed," Ashton said. "I shut it down. Full audit's underway. We're reordering materials. There will be delays."

"Delays? You think the city will accept that?"

"They'll have to. I'd rather take the hit on the timeline than have another body bag on site. If that's a problem for the board, they can bring it up at the next vote."

Reginald simpered. "You've got a lot on your plate. If you can't handle this, maybe I should come back and supervise."



Ashton pinched the bridge of his nose.


The hard-on was long gone, and in its place, a headache was settling in nicely.


"Sure. I'll bring you back. You can personally check the stability of every single scaffolding pole. Daily."


"What? I was thinking more of a management position."





"No."



Reginald spluttered on the other end. "I'm your father! You think I've got the stamina for that kind of grunt work?"



"You wanted to be involved. I'm making that happen.I'll have the appointment letter drafted by morning."


"No-no, wait, forget it, I'm good where I am..."Reginald backpedaled fast.


He might've been arrogant, but he wasn't suicidal.
One full day on-site and he'd be carried out in a body bag-or at least a neck brace.
"This is a government project," he switched tactics,his tone suddenly cautious. "The press already caught a whiff of it. Some trash blogs are reporting it.If this trends, stock will drop. You should've killed the story the second it broke."
Ashton's patience snapped clean in half.
"My priority was keeping the man alive. If he dies, no headline in the world is big enough to bury that.And in case you missed it, l've already shut the story down. I'm tracking every post, every feed. I don't need you playing PR consultant over the phone."
He was about to hang up when Reginald whined,"You don't respect me. Not a bit. Look how you talk to me."

Ashton tilted his head, rolling his neck until it cracked. "How I talk to you depends on how you act.You get what you give."
Another beat of breathing. Then Reginald sighed.


"Forget it. WWhatever. Anyway, we've been asking you to come back for dinner. Not me-your grandfather.He asked for you himself. You ignoring him now too?"


"His birthday's coming up. I'll be there."


"At least you've got some manners left."


Ashton paused, then added flatly, "One more thing.Thought I'd give you a heads-up. I'm married. I'll be bringing her with me. If anyone so much as pulls a face at her, I swear I'll burn the place down with all of you still inside."


He hung up before Reginald could open his mouth again.


His eyes shifted to the study door.


Three doors down was Mirabelle's room.



She was in there.



Showering,maybe.
Or lying in bed, scrolling through videos.



Or... just sitting there, stewing, wondering why the hell he hadn't come knocking yet.


He wanted to.



His body wanted to.


Every muscle was strung tight, like he'd just done a full set of deadlifts with no rest.


The craving was physical now-crude, annoying,sharp-edged.





But-



He exhaled, as if trying to bleed the tension from his lungs.



Then he rang Cassian.


There was still work to clear.


Ramon Vega's status needed following up.


Dominic had better have an update.
The legal team needed marching orders-start prepping charges for that rat bastard in procurement who'd pocketed kickbacks and ordered garbage-grade steel.


If criminal negligence didn't stick, they'd find something else.


Truth was, he should've dealt with it all hours ago.


But Octavia Grey had given him one window-tonight or not at all.


So he'd made the dinner happen.


And after what Mirabelle had pulled in the car-sliding into his lap like she lived there, mouth hot and greedy on his, fingers threading through his hair-


Yeah. He'd do it again in a heartbeat.
###Chapter 79 Morning After
The next morning, we didn't talk about almost having car sex.


Because obviously, pretending nothing happened was the mature thing to do.


The silence stretched across the table like a bad wifi connection-patchy, tense, and just begging to crash.


I was the first to crack. "Can I ask you something?"


Ashton looked up. "Sure."


"I went to LGH that day, and Dominic said you were out on a date with some actress. Octavia Grey, he said. But then she told me last night you two are just mates. So, who was the mystery woman you were actually hooking up with?"


I'd told myself I didn't care.


Turns out I was fuall of shit.
His silence had been gnawing at me all morning.


He was the one who'd kissed me like he wanted to memorize the taste of my tongue, and now he was sitting here, sipping his coffee like we hadn't nearly dry-humped in a Maybach.


Ashton choked.



Full-on, coughing-up-a-lung choked.


He grabbed a napkin and wiped his mouth, coughing out, "I never went on a date with any actress.Dominic was just... talking nonsense."


"Right," I said, narrowing my eyes.


Because Dominic Everett, a man who looked like he alphabetized his Spotify playlists, just strikes me as the kind of guy who randomly makes up celebrity hookups for fun.



Sure.



But if Ashton wanted to lie, that was his problem.


It wasn't like our contract had a truth-telling clause.
He reached for his water and muttered, "Clearly I've been giving Dominic too little work. He's got too much time to be creative. I'll dock his pay."


Poor Dominic.



Somewhere across the city, he was probably sneezing and had no idea why his paycheck was about to suffer.



I took it out on my toast.



Four aggressive bites in and half a slice down,Ashton glanced up again.


"No one's stealing your food, Mira. You can slow down."



I gave him a smile that said "bite me."


So I couldn't ask about his secret shag partner and also couldn't chew my carbs like a normal person?


He cleared his throat and, in that clearly-I'm-trying voice,asked, "Did you send the sketches to Octavia?Was she happy with them?"
"Yeah. Sent theroughs last night. She said she loved them. I'Il tweak a few details today, and we can start sampling tomorrow. Only..."



I stared down at my empty pate.


Only I didn't have the bloody equipment.


No casting machine, no wax injector, no laser welder-just a pretty little sketch that couldn't magic itself into diamonds and gold.


If I wanted BloomState to actually exist, I had to go back to Nyx Collective and use their gear.


Which meant risking a Violet Lin sighting.


And I was not in the mood for that.


Ashton must have read my mind. "I've got a friend who owns a small jewelry studio. Not as polished as Nyx, but it'll get the job done."


My eyes lit up. "That'll be perfect. Thanks."


It wasn't just Violet I wanted to avoid.
It was also Savannah and the risk of her finding out l was designing red carpet jewelry for Octavia Grey.


If that got back to Nyx, I'd be labeled a traitor faster than you could say "conflict of interest."


Savannah wouldn't care-my contract said freelancer,loud and clear.


But Violet would twist it into some backstabbing,under-the-table betrayal, and I wasn't giving her the ammo.


After breakfast, I headed over to the studio Ashton recommended.


It was called Moss & Flame, and it was tucked behind a bakery in a part of the city where parking tickets reproduced like rabbits.


The owner, a wiry redhead in her fifties named Lorna,greeted me at the door like I was her long-lost niece.


She showed me around, and insisted-twice-that I call her if I needed anything, even if it was just a different gauge of saw blade.
I liked Lorna instantly, except she had this funny look on her face when I mentioned Ashton told me they were good friends.


The studio was a small place, but sharp.


Full toolkit-benches, loupes, torches, stone-setting tools-and they even cleared out a little office space for me, complete with a cracked leather chair and a coffee machine.


I stuck around all morning, working.


Started with CAD to tweak the finer angles on the design, then ran a 3D print of the main pieces in wax.


The resin came out a little rough, but it was good enough for molding.


For the more complex elements, like the lattice settings and that hinged clasp Octavia liked, I cast a quick prototype in brass to test the functionality and make sure nothing snapped under pressure.


Used a micromotor to clean up the edges, then soldered a sample setting just to see how the curves held under heat.


Not showroom quality, but it was taking shape.


I didn't realize it was way past noon until my stomach growled.


The studio wasn't close to Ashton's house, so heading back for lunch felt like a trek.


I wandered into a nearby mall and grabbed something spicy-jerk chicken with rice and plantains.


Just as I sat down, plastic fork in hand, I looked up-and nearly choked on a pepper flake.


Serenna Oakley.


We hadn't seen each other since the Laurent party.


You know, the one where I punched her in the face.


I locked eyes with my chicken and pretended she didn't exist.


Didn't work.


Stilettos clicked. Shadow loomed. Poison perfume hit my nose two seconds before her voice did.


"Bit far from Nyx Collective, isn't it? What are you doing here?"


###Chapter 80 Ghost from the Past
I didn't even glance at her.



Just kept shoveling spicy chicken over rice into my mouth.



Serenna dropped herself into the seat opposite mine and dumped her shopping bags on the floor.


She huffed. "Not going to talk? Last time we saw each other, you slapped me and ripped out a chunk of my hair. It still hasn't grown back, by the way.You've got some nerve not showing up to apologize.Now you're blanking me like I don't exist. Ever heard of basic manners?"



"Manners? You're the one who sat down without an invitation, is currently spraying spit all over my jerk chicken, and taking up a seat that an actual paying customer might want. So unless you're planning to order something, eat it, and shut up, I suggest you find the nearest exit and flounce right back out."


Her mouth opened, then closed.


She choked on her own comeback for a second,probably trying to decide if she should scream or sulk.



Then her face lit up with petty delight.


"I just figured you might want some company," she said, her voice syrupy with fake sympathy. "I heard the Grangers pulled back all their wedding invites.After you chased Rhys around like a loyal golden retriever for years, he's finally tossed you. Poor Mira."


She clicked her tongue. "What now? Aunt Caroline said you're even cutting ties with your family.So if no man wants you and your family's out, what are you going to do-live under a bridge?"


I gave her a cold smile. "Wow. Everything out of your mouth starts and ends with men. Can't survive without a dick in your orbit? I'm actually curious to see what kind of Prince Charming ends up stuck with you. You had a crush on Rhys, didn't you? Well,now's your chance. Just a heads-up though,Catherine is in the picture now. You'll have to fight her for him."



"I so don't like him anymore," she denied. "He's a total player. I'd never go for someone like that."


She stared at me, hunting for cracks.



Probably expected me to be moping, mascara running, wailing about lost love and betrayal.


But all she got was the top of my head and the sound of my fork scraping the plate.


She snapped her fingers."Oi, are you deaf? Don't care about Rhys anymore? Fine. But I bet you'll care about what I'm about to say."


"I bet | won't."



"I mean it's big. Like, life-altering."


I wiped my mouth. "Still don't care."
Her nostrils flared. "God, you're such a cow. Fine, I'll tell you anyway-Isobel Brooke's back in town."


My hand stalled an inch from my iced coffee.


My expression didn't change-much-but the twitch in my brow must've betrayed me.



Serenna saw it.



She latched onto that flicker like a parasite finding blood.


"Ha! I knew it. You're not so unbothered after all. You should be scared. Remember what happened? Her family shipped her off because of you. Word is, she's had it rough out there. You think she forgot? You think you're not at the top of her revenge list?"



Her grin stretched like she thought she'd won something.



But the only thing she'd ever win was Most Likely to Be Slapped at a Wedding.



I sipped my coffee.
Bit too much ice, not enough espresso.



I knew Serenna wasn't warning me out of the kindness of her cold, botoxed heart.


She just wanted to see if I'd flinch.


See if the big, bad Mira Vance still had old ghosts rattling around in her closet.



And okay. If we're dragging skeletons out, let's talk about Isobel bloody Brooke.


Back in school, if there was one person who could make me sweat, it wasn't a teacher, or a parent, or even my high-maintenance sister.


It was her.



Isobel.



Queen Bitch of Westbridge Prep.


Mean girl royalty, with just enough money and power to ruin someone's life before breakfast and still make it to third period looking fresh as fuck.
While I kept my head down with textbooks and sketchbooks, she held court from the back row,doing her makeup and filming TikToks for her adoring fans.



We stayed out of each other's orbit.


Until she made me her target.


All because the guy she liked had a crush on me.


Not that l ever flirted back.


But girls like her didn't need a reason, just a target.


Hell, I didn't even know the guy's name.


Didn't know the real reason until later.


Until I beat it out of her.


To Isobel, the idea that someone might choose me over her wasn't just unthinkable-it was blasphemy.


And I had to be punished.


l ignored the passive-aggressive digs and the giggles behind my back.
Every school had that, and I had better things to worry about.


But my not reacting only fueled her.


She'd graduated beyond harmless locker room pranks.





The bathroom lock-ins and water dumps didn't get the reaction she wanted, so she went full sociopath-she spiked my drink at the school dance.


Someone swapped my soda for vodka-laced with something else-and before I knew it, I was stumbling like a half-sedated raccoon.



Dizzy. Blurred. Disoriented.


Led out of the dance hall and straight into a trap.


Into a building.


To some scumbag who'd been circling me for months.




What they didn't plan on was me coming back swinging.

I smashed his nose with a jagged piece of rebar.


Might have also broken a couple of ribs.


I escaped, called the cops, filed the report, did everything right.


And then my parents dropped the case.


Turns out, the Brooke family had connections.


They threw hush money at my parents, painted it as a "teenage misunderstanding."


The Vances took the payout.


I wasn't even consulted.


Just a signature away from justice, and they folded.


So I handled it myself.
 ###Chapter 81 Ghost from the Past


One month later, I found Isobel walking to her car alone.

I waited by the trunk, yanked a sack over her head, dragged her behind the bleachers, and beat the smugness out of her.

She never saw me.

No one did.

Then I did it again.

And again.

Every week, likeclockwork.

Every time she showed up to school with a bruise or a limp, I made sure I had an airtight alibi.

Isobel cracked fast.

She couldn't handle it without her little entourage fluttering around her.

By week five of being jumped out of nowhere, she quit showing up altogether.

Her parents pulled her out and shipped her off to a boarding school overseas.

With her gone, the bullies backed off.

Guess they figured I might put a bag over their heads next.

But I didn't come out unscathed either.

I was sixteen.

I'd barely kissed a boy, let alone fought off some drunk creep inan abandoned building.

So yeah,maybe that night carved something jagged into me.

Maybe that's why I took up boxing.
A hand waved in front of my face. "Hello? Youheard what I said?"

I snapped my mind back to the present. "Yeah, I heard. You talk loud enough to be heard five blocks away."

"So,you do remember Isobel, right?" Serenna's smile sharpened. "You're not still traumatized, are you?"

I stood up,forcing her to tilt her chin up to keep eye contact. "If she's stupid enough to show her face, I'll make sure to continue where we left off. And you?" I stared down at her. "Might want to watch your step,sweetheart. I hit a lot harder than I used to."

***


I'd just returned to Moss & Flame after lunch when my phone lit up.

"Mirabelle, please. You've got to come back." Savannah sounded like she was two seconds from crying or committing a crime. "Eliza Black's torn the sketches apart ten times now and still hates them. The film festival's right around the corner. If Nyx Collective doesn't deliver, we'll have to pay breach penalties-serious ones."

"You do realize Violet won't let me help unless I agree to be her assistant, right?" | said. "And there's no version of reality where that's happening."

"I'm the boss," Savannah huffed. "What she wants doesn't matter.I'll double your pay. Just come back and sort this out. For me, please."

My eyes flicked to the last text from my bank.

Let's just say I wasn't scraping for Uber fare anymore.
A
Double pay used to sound like salvation.

Now? Not so much.

"Yeah, I'm gonna pass,"I said.

Her voice turned into a high-pitched whine. "You've been gone for days. Don't tell me you're actually thinking of quitting?"

"No." Not yet, anyway. "I've still got some annual leave to use. And don't forget, I'm a freelancer. I come and go as I please."
She groaned. "God, you're such a pain. I should've seen this coming. But I had to try, didn't I? Fine. Go enjoy your precious holiday. But we're clear, right? Holiday. Not resignation. If you resign, I swear I'll block it like my life depends on it. Don't make me get on my knees, Mira. I'm too old for that."

I laughed, "Fine.Holiday it is."

We'd circle back to the qutting bit later.

"Oh, by the way, Vanna, can I take on my own projects while I'm off?"

There was a pause.

Then her tone sharpened with suspicion. "Side projects? What kind? With who?"

I kept it vague. "Nothing specific yet. Just... something I'm considering."

"Right, right, of course," she said, her voice edging into panic. "You can, obviously. I mean, you're still Nyx Collective, yeah? So anything you do goes out under our name. That was in the contract, remember?"

"I remember."

"Good, because we'll promote the hell out of it. Your name front and center-superstar designer, all that.Mira,really, working with you has been a dream. You basically built Nyx. Honestly, I thought Eliza Black would go for your concept. No idea what kind of brain-dead manager she's got whispering in her ear. But hey, client's king,right? Just...cut me some slack, okay?"

I gave a shrug she couldn't see and said, "Yeah. I'll keep the Nyx name on it."

Savannah let out a breath. A bit too loud. Then,tentatively:"Okay, but... what kind of projects are we talking about?"

I didn't answer.

She pushed on. "I mean, seriously-what could you land out there that tops designing custom pieces for a damn A-lister?"

I stayed quiet. Let her speculate.

"If you come back," she said quickly, "and Eliza Black's wearing Nyx at the Venice Film Festival-that's massive. That's the kind of exposure most designers never get."
Still nothing from me.

"You and Violet Lin would both get credit," she added, a little too fast. "Come on, Mira, this is Venice. The Venice International Film Festival. That kind of spotlight doesn't just fall into your lap."

I rubbed my temple, but she kept at it.
"You've got taste. Talent. Hell, range. But you're stilyoung, babe. Your name needs more traction. Don't waste the momentum."

If she'd said that a few months ago, I might've caved.
Back then,I would've sold a kidney for that kind of press.

But now.I had bigger things on my plate.

I leaned back in my chair, letting the silence stretch before I said,"Let it go, Vanna. I've got a lot going on right now. But once I'm done, we'lI talk."
She didn't like it.

I could hear her grinding her teeth through the phone, but she didn't push.

Smart woman.

***

I got home just before nine.
Wolfed down dinner,then hit the shower.
Scrubbed twice, flossed twice, brushed twice.
Sprayed breath spray for a full minute, then popped a mint for good measure.
I almost flopped down on the sofa-but stopped.

Too obvious.
Sitting there in full makeup as if I was waiting for him?

Yeah,no.
I wasn't that desperate to continue our rehearsal.

Except...I kind of was.

So far, all we'd done was some light arm-draping and a couple of those over-the-clothes hugs.

G-rated at best.

But after that dinner with Octavia, things had shifted.

Were we adding a kiss now?

I grabbed my compact and flipped it open.

Gave the mirror a breath test.

Minty. No garlic ghost from dinner.

Lipstick: matte,smudge-proof.

Good to go.

I waited.

Except Ashton never came home.
###Chapter 82 Pick Up Where We Left Off


The night sucked.

Cold sheets.

No sleep.

Just me and my traitor brain spinning in circles.

In the morning, I saw his shoes by the door.

That meant he'd come back sometime in the dead of night but was now gone again.

I could't pretend I wasn't disappointed.

But work slammed into me, and I buried myself in it.

I spent the next few days camped out at Moss & Flame, working ten-hour shifts, hunched over gem settings and wax casts.

I came home too wrecked to care about anything, let alone our 'rehearsal.:

Ashton was apparently busy too.

No sign of him for days.

Not even a shadow in the hallway.

Our whole flirt-to-convince-the-family thing?

Dead in the water.

Which-fine by me.

Sort of.

Ashton was hot, yeah, but cuddling with someone that good-looking without actual benefits was borderline torture.
Then, finally, something worth celebrating: I wrapped up the custom set for Octavia Grey.

Handmade, hand-set, one of a kind,absolute knockout.

And too precious to be entrusted to couriers.

I took them straight to her agent's office myself.

Octavia was all smiles and gasps, cooing over the necklace like it was a newborn.

She grabbed both my hands, shaking them like she was trying to absorb my talent through touch.

"This is so much better than the overpriced crap those luxury brands churn out. Honestly, I don't know what's going on in their design departments. Half the time, it looks like they let a blind pigeon do the sketches. But this? This is art. I'm wearing this to the festival, no question. I'll be the hottest bitch on the red carpet. Doesn't matter if it's Cannes or Cleveland-nobody's topping this."

I beamed at her.

She beamed at the jewelry.

"But seriously," she went on, frowning, "why are you wasting your talent at some no-name studio? I've never heard of Nyx Collective before. It's small, isn't it? With your skills, you should be running your own label."

That stung.

Mostly because she was right.

A couple of days later, my annual leave was officially up.

I had no choice but to haul my arse back to work.

Quitting still wasn't on the table.

Not yet.

Partly because Savannah had been the only one mad enough to sign a fresh-out-of-uni nobody.

I owed her for that.

And partly because I wasn't planning on crawling into another design studio ever again.
I was done making magic for someone else's name.

My next step was my own studio.

My rules, my name on the door, my signature-and only my signature-on the designs,

Only problem was, I didn't have the clout or the capital.

Yet.

Nyx Collective was in meltdown mode when I stepped back into it.

People were speed-walking like it was an Olympic event, someone in comms was crying into their smoothie,and even Savannah's usually composed assistant had mascara smudged halfway to her ear.

Tasha spotted me and lit up.

"Mira!" she chirped, waving enthusiastically.

The front desk girl was in her early twenties, blue braids today, holographic nails, wore cat ears unironically.

"Didn't think you'd actually come back," she said, grinning as she leaned over the counter."We were taking bets."

"Wow, rude,"I deadpanned. "What were the odds?"

"Sixty-forty you'd rage-quit. I had faith, though. You owe me a coffee."

"I owe you nothing." I gestured to the hive of activity. "What's going on here?"

"Yeah, total war zone today. Violet's been tweaking Eliza Black's designs like a maniac. Eighteen revisions.Eighteen. Can you believe it? | thought Savannah was going to start foaming at the mouth."

I blinked. "Eighteen? Jesus. What's she doing, engraving runes on it?"

"Wouldn't be shocked. They finally signed off on the final version like-two hours ago? So now everyone's basically speed-running production like it's a boss level. Eliza's flight is at 2 p.m."

I looked at my watch.

It was already 10 a.m.
People were shouting over each other, elbow-deep in foam padding,checking every clasp and stone under brutal lighting.

Someone barked about airport couriers, another yelled for a lint roller.

Violet Lin was busy stuffing boxes into bigger boxes.

She didn't see me at first, so I just hung back, observing.

I wasn't close, but I caught a glimpse when she cracked the lid open.

Just a flash.

But it was enough.

My eyes locked on the set inside.

Gorgeous.

Flashy,but tasteful-just the sort of thing that made you tilt your head and go...

Hang on.

Something about it tugged at me, like I'd seen it before.

I squinted, but I was too far away to get a good look.

Probably just my imagination,right?

Violet suddenly caught me staring, and it was like I'd just triggered a fire alarm in her brain.
:
She slammed the box shut, spun around to face me. "What the hell are you looking at? You trying to steal my inspiration for your own designs? Is that it? Planning on copying me,huh?"

"Do you seriously think I'd waste my time copying your designs?" I snorted. "What is this, 2005? Get real."

"You-!" She glared at me like she was ready to throw hands.

Then she shouted at the nearest person, "Get this to the airport, now. Don't even think about missing Eliza Black's flight. If you do, you'll be the one paying for the breach of contract, got it?"

The poor guy was shaking, barely managing to hold the box without dropping it.
I think he thought Violet was about to explode if he didn't move fast enough.

Violet spun back to me, now all smug like she'd just won the war. "I've got the final pieces done, the flight's still got hours to go, no need to panic."

"Congrats,"I said dryly.

"I hear Vanna called you, told you to come back and help me, but you couIdn't be bothered, huh? You were just waiting for me to screw up so you could have a good laugh,right?"

I raised an eyebrow and looked at her like she'd lost her mind. "Babe, do you have any idea how paranoid you sound right now? Have you seén a doctor about this, or should I take you myself?"

Her eyes narrowed. "Then why'd you pick today of all days to come back? You wanted to watch me crash and burn, admit it."
###Chapter 83 Meltdown Mode


"I admit nothing. When I choose to come back has absolutely nothing to do with you. Same goes for whether you hit Eliza Black's deadline-none of it's my problem. So stop projecting."

Violet let out a derisive hum, clearly not buying a word I said.

"Fine," she said, looking all pleased with herself. "Even if you agreed to come back, it's too late. I've already set things up with Eliza. She's going to blow up at the film festival in a few days, and once she posts about me on social media, I'll be a star designer. You won't even be good enough to carry my bags, let alone keep up with me."

I walked back to my desk, letting her ramble on while l ignored her.

Violet had no clue.

She was aboutto find out the hard way that with all her rush and last-minute changes to the designs, there was no way she was going to hit the mark.

I wouldn't be surprised if poor Eliza Black ended up looking like a fool at the film festival.

***

After that little verbal cage match, Violet actually chilled out.

She was too busy fantasizing about her big break as a 'world-famous jewelry designer' to bother picking fights with me.

A few days passed without her dragging me into another playground-level shouting match, and that suited me just fine.

Not that I had time for her nonsense anyway-l had bigger things on my plate.

The main event I'd been 'rehearsing' for was finally looming.

The night before Edouard Laurent's 80th birthday, Ashton called me into the living room after dinner.

"We've both been busy," he said, sitting ramrod straight, looking all businesslike. "We've slacked off on our practice. Tomorrow's the party, so we're doing a quick run-through tonight."
"Okay," I said, without hesitation.

We'd barely seen each other in the past few days, what with me being up to my eyeballs in jewelry work for Octavia Grey.

It had been kind of a relief, but now...I was nervous.

Tomorrow, I'd be in front of the whole Laurent family with him.

I couldn't afford to mess up, not with everything on the line.

I stepped forward and-without even thinking-lowered myself onto his lap.

The move was so smooth, I surprised myself.

My thighs locked around his as if by muscle memory, and the jolt that shot up my spine was instant.

No way to pretend I didn't feel it.

Ashton's hands found my waist like magnets, his palms hot through the fabric, his fingers resting just on the edge of familiarity.

God, I'd been trying so hard not to think about him since that kiss in the car, but it was impossible now.

The angle of our bodies, the tension pulsing between us-it was the backseat all over again, minus the leather upholstery and the eavesdropping driver.

His eyes pinned me.

Blue.

I'd always known that.

But now they looked like Kashmir sapphires-deep, vivid, seductive.

A stone that could mesmerize you into reaching out... and slice you open if you weren't careful.

Suddenly, I wasn't so sure another 'rehearsal' was a smart idea.

I felt like I was toeing the edge of something dangerous.

One wrong breath and I'd tumble-straight into territory I couldn't joke my way out of.
"See? Not bad, right?" I forced a grin, coward's instinct kicking in. "Still got the muscle memory. Tomorrow,no one will suspect a thing."

I tried to ease off his lap.

"I don't think we need another rehearsal. I'm kind of exhausted. Let's skip practice tonight. I promise I won't embarrass you tomorrow."

I'd handled enough black-tie dinners and brutal design competitions to hold my own.

Rich snobs, harsh judges, backhanded compliments-l'd seen it all.

And yeah, not to be vain or anything, but I've got a face that doesn't hurt either.

I was just about to push myself off him when his hand slid around the back of my neck, fingers pressing lightly,holding me in place.

"I'm a firm believer in being prepared," he said.

Before I could come up with something clever, his grip tightened, and I pitched forward, right into him-chest to chest, thigh to thigh, heat igniting where our skin met.

Then his mouth was on mine, soft but unyielding, and the contact wiped out every half-formed thought in my brain.

"Mmm..." I tried to speak, but his kiss swallowed the words.

It was like the world stopped.

The only thing I could feel, taste, was him.

His tongue slid against mine, slow at first, then deeper, tasting every inch of me like he was starving.

His lips were warm, firm, and everything else faded into the background.

There was just the heat, the friction of our bodies pressed together.

I was sinking into him, my fingers digging into his shirt, pulling him closer, like I wanted to lose myself in him.

The kiss made my head spin, faster and faster, and then-suddenly-he moved, and I was on my back, with him above me.
The soft give of the sofa beneath me was the only thing keeping me anchored.

His chest pressed against mine, tight enough that I couldn't breathe easily, but it was exactly what I wanted.

The weight of him felt safe, like nothing could touch me as long as he was there.

And, damn it, when his lips left mine, my whole body felt like it had melted into the sofa, as if I'd been soaked in warm honey.

I was breathless, dizzy, and very much wanted to pull him back to me.

Ashton's eyes locked onto mine, dark with something I couldn't quite name.

His gaze dropped from my lips, lingering on the curve of my neck, and I saw him tense, his jaw clenched.

I didn't reed to be a genius to know he was struggling to keep his composure.

He was trying so hard not to lose control.

His hand brushed the bare skin of my lower back as I shifted slightly, and holy hell, if his fingers didn't send a shockwave through me.

No fabric, just his skin on mine, and suddenly all I could think about was how much I wanted more.

His breath hitched, and for a moment, I thought he might lose control, might take it all the way.
###Chapter 84 Final Rehearsal


He crossed his legs-tight, as if that was the only thing stopping him from yanking me closer.

I could feel his control slipping.

His fingers clenched the sofa cushion like he needed an anchor.

Damn, he was fighting hard.

I could see it all over him.

Then,suddenly,he snapped.

Not in a wild,throw-me-down way.

No, he slammed his palm into his other hand, as if he was physically trying to shake himself out of whatever trance I'd pulled him into.

He pushed up to stand, but my arms stayed locked around his neck, not ready to let go.

He swore under his breath.

Then he kissed me again, fast, hard, breathless.

"Don't look at me like that," he muttered against my lips."Orl'll..."

His words barely registered in my mind.

I was already drunk on the taste of him, high on the heat, melting into him.

Then he lifted me, carried me towards the stairs.

One moment, I was in his lap, and the next, I was on my back, flat against the sheets in my room.

Then he...

Left.

The door clicked shut behind him.
Soft, but sharp enough to slice through the haze l was in.

He was gone.

I lay there, boneless.

Like someone had unplugged every wire in my body and replaced it with static.

My skin still tingled.

My pulse was still racing.

And I couldn't tell which was stronger-relief or disappointment.

Part of me was weirdly glad he'd stopped.

If he hadn't, I might've just stripped him naked and begged him to ruin me.

But the other part-the one powered by hormones and sheer, shameless lust-was screaming.

Who the hell walks away when a woman's practically throwing herself at him?

Was I not sexy enough? Hot enough?

Was he just that noble?

What the hell was stopping him?

I was clearly all in.

And judging by my flushed cheeks and throbbing everything, my body hadn't exactly been subtle about it.

But he'd walked away.

Was he hung up on someone?

Saving himself for some sainted ex he still lit a candle for?

Like Rhys had done with Catherine while pretending to date me?

Please.

What were the odds I'd fall for the only two men in all of Skyline City who knew how to keep it zipped when temptation was literally on their lap?

I sat up, pulled my shirt forward, glanced down.

"No way. Still hot," I told my boobs.

So why the hell was Ashton acting like a monk in a meat market?

***


The next day was the big one-Edouard Laurent's 80th birthday bash.

I had no intention of showing up looking like I was trying too hard.

So I grabbed a simple white dress, understated, clean, no bells or whistles.

I let my long, dark hair fall freely, nothing too fussy.

Not a single piece of jewelry, not even a stud.

When I came downstairs, Ashton was in the living room, waiting.

His eyes locked on me the entire way down.

Not a casual glance.

This was the kind of look that peeled back layers, that imagined every detail beneath the dress.

The fire in his gaze, the way his jaw flexed-it wasn't subotle.

He wasn't picturing a polite family dinner.

He was picturing something far more dangerous.

I saw it in the twitch of his fingers, the rigid set of his shoulders.

The heat that shot through me was instant.

Part of me wanted to gloat-see what you walked away from last night?

I almost did a little twirl just to twist the knife... but the stairs were steep, and I wasn't about to somersault into the wall.
Another part of me itched to demand answers-if you're so good at mentally undressing me, why didn't you just follow through? What the hell's stopping you?

But this wasn't the moment for that kind of question.

When I reached the bottom, I looked up at him with a teasing smile.

"Well? What do you think?"

He didn't answer right away.

His eyes stayed on me, devouring.

Finally, after what felt like five years, he said, low and hoarse, "Beautiful."

I reached for his hand, and he took it without hesitation, pulling me towards the door.

When we reached the car, he held on a second longer, then finally let go.

***


The parking lot at the Laurent estate was packed.

Old cars, new cars-all gleaming, all expensive.

Tonight was a milestone that clearly warranted pulling out every last stop.

As I stepped out of the car, I took in the scene.

The place was buzzing.

Family,friends, distant cousins dragged out of hiding-everyone who could make it was here.

Ashton's family tree was less tree, more tangle.

Edouard Laurent had a few brothers and sisters, and each one had their own army of children and grandchildren.

Ashton's father, Reginald, was Edouard's youngest son.

Reginald had three sons, Ashton being the eldest.

Throw in a bunch of distant relatives, and you had a party that could rival any school reunion.
Ashton's arm slipped around my waist, and we walked towards the house in sync.

Any nerves I'd had were long gone.

I clocked the man at the door-probably a butler-do a double take.

He blinked, like his brain needed a moment to compute.

Even the staff couldn't help sneaking glances.

Ashton had timed our entrance perfectly.

The living room was already crowded-clusters of people laughing, catching up, or locked in that awkward family small talk you only ever heard at holidays.

But the second we stepped through the door, silence.

Like someone had hit mute.

Every head turned.

Even the ones pretending not to notice got elbowed by whoever stood next to them.
###Chapter 85 Paused on the Brink


I could feel every single set of eyes on us.

Ashton was... well, Ashton.

He looked like a walking piece of art.

But not just beautiful.

Dangerous-beautiful.

Like one of those hyperreaistic 3D paintings of a cliff.

Stare too long and you start to feel the drop.

Me? I wasn't bad either.

Maybe a little less angelic than him, but definitely more than presentable.

But I could tell it wasn't the looks that had frozen the room.

It was the way I was linking arms with him-easy, intimate, completely unselfconscious.

Thanks to our multiple rehearsals (which, fine, had paid off), we didn't look like just a party fling.

We looked like the real thing.

I could practically see the thought bubbles forming above every head:

"Isn't that Mirabelle Vance?"

"Wasn't she engaged to Rhys Granger?"

"Didn't she cause a scene at the last Laurent event?"

"How is she not blacklisted?"

But the main headline was clear:

"What the hell is she doing with Ashton Laurent?"
The whispers started immediately.

We reached the center of the room.

Ashton gave the crowd a slow once-over.

Then came the look.

The kind of look that said: What are you staring at? Mind your own business.

It was as if he'd flipped a switch.

The air snapped back to life.

Whispers cut off.

Then, after a second of stunned silence, the conversations resumed, but the topics had shifted.

Everyone went back to pretending they weren't dying to know what was going on.

Eyes still flicked our way, though.

Then, from the edge of the room, a man stumbled over.

Mid-to-late forties.

Handsome, if you squinted and ignored the wine bloat and under-eye bags.

His expression was all confusion and shock.

His mouth opened like it had forgotten how to form words.

"You-you said you were bringing your wife. This is her?"

Ashton didn't miss a beat. "That's right."

The man looked like someone had just unplugged his brain.

Everyone here knew I'd been engaged to Rhys Granger.

The Grangers had only just clawed back their wedding invite, and now-bam-I was here, allegedly married to Ashton Laurent, like it was no big deal.
I recognized the man, but to be sure, I turned and whispered, "Your father?"

Ashton nodded. "Reginald Laurent."

Reginald's hand went to his chest like he was physically restraining a heart attack.

His face was turning an alarming shade of crimson. "Ashton, how could you-how could you marry-"

I beamed at him and stuck out my hand. "Mr. Laurent, it's so lovely to meet you!"

He froze.

Even his eyes stopped blinking.

Was he about to faint?

"Mr. Laurent," I said again, layering on my sweetest fake-innocent smile. "I brought gifts for everyone. I'll have the driver bring them in shortly."

His face turned an even deeper shade of maroon.

For a second, I honestly thought he might combust.

His Adam's apple bobbed-up, down, up again-like he was trying to swallow a dozen questions at once, all of them jammed up in his throat like rush-hour traffic.

Ashton frowned. "Mirabelle put a lot of thought into those gifts. The least you could do is say thank you."

Saying thank you to me was clearly the last thing on Reginald's mind.

His face had gone from red to a deeply worrying purple. "I-I didn't know..."

"You didn't prepare any gifts?" Ashton cut in, voice sharp. "Even after I told you I was bringing my wife here today?"

He let that word hang for effect.

"Cash will do. At least then I won't have to worry about you handing Mira something useless. There are five of you in your family, so two million each should be a good start."

Reginald's eyes bulged.
I was half worried he was about to burst a blood vessel.

"Five? And what do you mean 'your family'?" Reginald's voice cracked like an old floorboard. "It's six,including you. Aren't you my son? Aren't you supposed to be one of us?"

"Now you're calling me your son?" Ashton arched an eyebrow. "Well then, since your son just got married,shouldn't you be giving a wedding gift? And since you skipped the engagement one, let's make up for lost time.Four million each should do it."

Reginald was trembling.

Rage or shock-l couldn't quite tell.

But I did know this: he wouldn't make a scene.

Not here.

Ashton had briefed me beforehand.

He'd aIready shuffled the more useless Laurent cronies off the main board at LGH, parking them in dusty little side offices.

Reginald was currently languishing at Laurent City Estates, a subsidiary where he could do the least possible damage.

And, if need be, he could be shuffled farther away, like Burkina Faso.

Ashton held all the strings now, and Reginald knew it.

While he stood there fumbling between outrage and submission, a woman and a younger man approached.

The woman was immaculate.

Expensive dress, impeccable hair, and a smile so sugary it almost matched my fake one.

She stepped forward like she'd been waiting for her moment all night.

"Ashton's right," she said smoothly. "As the in-laws, we should be the ones giving a proper gift to the new bride.Two million's a bit modest, though. Lucien-Ashton's cousin-just got engaged, and his parents gave the couple five million each. I'm sure Ashton's wife is worth a lot more."

Ashton didn't even look at her.
Didn't say a word.

Just let the silence stretch, cool and cutting.

From the way she clung to Reginald's arm, I knew exactly who she was.

Gwendolyn Laurent. Reginald's wife.

Her words were perfectly polite, and she even sounded like she was sticking up for me, but I'd met enough snakes in high heels to recognize the type.

The kind of woman who'd backstab you with one hand and give your shoulder a reassuring pat with the other.

No wonder Ashton hadn't said much about her during our briefing.

All I knew was that she was the one who'd convinced Reginald to ship a barely-teenaged Ashton off to an overseas boarding school-alone, underprepared, and still too young to shave-while her own two sons were kept safe and coddled in Skyline City.

She reminded me of my mother,Caroline.

Different tactics, same poison.

And that smnile-God,that smile.

It made me want to punch her square in the face.

I leaned towards Ashton as I beamed at Gwendolyn.

"Aww, that's so sweet of you. You're really giving me five million? I don't even know what to say."
 ###Chapter 86 Meet the Parents


Ashton might have chuckled.

He cleared his throat. "Mira, I think she said more than five million."

I widened my eyes and let out a delighted little gasp. "Ohhh, that's so generous of you!"

Gwendolyn nearly bit her tongue.

But she couldn't back out now-not without losing face.

"Oh, it's-nothing," she said, her smile faltering.

She jabbed Reginald in the ribs, who was still stuck in buffering mode. "Reggie will handle it today, won't you,Reggie?"

"W-what?" Reginald blinked. "Hande what?"

"The transfer, the... gift," she hissed, before turning to me with a sugary smile. "It's Mirabelle, right?"

"Right." I shook her hand and resisted the urge to scrub mine with a disinfectant wipe.

"Did you and Ashton just get married yesterday?"

"No," I said, on guard.

"No? Oh, I only asked because no one informed us about the wedding. I thought... well, never mind." She smiled indulgently. "Not a word to the parents-so typical of the younger generation, isn't it? All impulse, no tradition."

She gave Ashton a fond, mildly scolding look, as if she actually thought of him as her own. Then back to me."If it weren't for Grandpa Edouard's birthday, we'd have never known you two tied the knot. Such a shame,don't you think?"

I nearly rolled my eyes.

Of course, she wouldn't dare aim the thinly veiled dig at Ashton.
So the barbs came my way.

Did I look like a wide-eyed ingénue?

Maybe I didn't care for all this veiled insult nonsense, but that didn't mean I didn't know how to volley back.

Before I could say a word, Ashton cut in. "You're not my mother. And my wife doesn't owe you a visit."

Gwendolyn's left cheek twitched, her smiling mask slipping a little.

Ashton didn't lower his voice.

He didn't care that the room was full of people pretending not to eavesdrop, even as their ears were twitching like antennae.

"Ashton..." Gwendolyn's voice wobbled. A trembling hand pressed to her chest like she'd been stabbed. "All these years, I've treated you like my own son. I never once minded your... your situation, being born out of wedlock,How can you say that to me?"

She was already dabbing at her eyes.

I shot Ashton a glance, bracing for his reaction.

She hadn't used the word exactly, but it hung there, unspoken-illegitimate.

I'd heard the whispers.

The moment Ashton returned to Skyline City, the gossip spread like wildfire.

There were different versions, some nastier than others.

I didn't know which one was true, and I wasn't close enough to him to ask.

Ashton's face was granite.

If he was rattled, he didn't show it.

"Out of wedlock?" he said coldly. "You know damn well who was the one cheating while still married."
He shot Reginald a withering look, who seemed to have just realized he'd been bled of five million times two.

The color drained from his face as the math caught up with him.

Then Ashton turned to Gwendolyn.

"If you want to make a scene in front of everyone, I'm more than happy to settle things right here."

That was when the young man who'd been standing off to the side like a mildly interested bystander finally stepped in.

"Ash, don't say that about Mum," he said, not quite confrontational, more placating. "She didn't mean anything by it, alright? She just meant you two haven't come to visit. Chill out."

That had to be Declan, Gwendolyn's youngest and most coddled.

He had the kind of flawless skin, bright teeth, and peachy complexion that only came from never having worked a day in his life.

Spoiled? Almost certainly.

Useless? Probably.

But at least he had enough guts to defend his mother, I'd give him that.

I knew he didn't hold a position at any LGH subsidiary, which made sense the moment Ashton said:

"Your stipend next month-"

He didn't even need to finish.

Declan folded instantly.

He grabbed Ashton's hand, then thought better of it and let go when Ashton didn't return the gesture.

He gave a sheepish grin. "Come on, Ash, big bro, don't do that to me. You've already cut my stipend twice in two months. Any more and I'll be living under a bridge."

Ashton said nothing, just tapped his finger against his arm, waiting.
Declan blinked, then lit uplike he'd finally decoded the unspoken command.

He turned to me with a face-splitting grin.

"Mirabelle, right? I've heard so much about you. Congrats on the wedding. May your future be filled with sunshine, rainbows, and ridiculous amounts of happiness. You and Ashton are perfect together. Anyone can see that."

I shook the hand he offered. "Thank you."

It was hard to dislike himn, even knowing who his mother was.

Speaking of...

Declan added, "Don't mind Mum. Half the time she doesn't know what she's talking about."

"Declan!" Gwendolyn snapped.

He waved her off like a fly. "Anyway, you should come around more. I can show you around.Or-" He caught Ashton's look and backpedaled fast. "Or Ash can show you. You've got to see the indoor pool. I redid the whole thing. It's basically a spa now. You'd love it."

Then he looked at Ashton like a golden retriever waiting for praise.

Ashton's tone softened just a notch. "Your stipend's as usual."

Declan straightened."Thanks,bro!"

I watched the easy rapport between them, fascinated.

I really liked that, despite Gwendolyn, Ashton didn't hold it against Declan.

He even seemed to indulge him.

I didn't learn the truth until much later: when Ashton had been shipped off overseas with barely enough stipend to cover food and shelter, it was Declan who'd quietly siphoned off money from his own generous allowance and sent it to him.
Proof that,occasionally, the apple does fall far from the tree.

Declan turned to Gwendolyn. "Mum, seriously, it's a happy day. Don't say anything that'll ruin it. Just zip it and smile for the cameras."

Gwendolyn blinked, stunned. "What did I even say?"

She might have brushed off anything from Ashton with that frosty composure of hers, but coming from her own son, that cut deeper.

"Just don't say anything stupid," Declan said offhandedly.

Gwendolyn's face turned an alarming shade-red, then purplish-like she was this close to throttling him on the spot.
###Chapter 87 Insults and Ingratiation


Ashton gave Declan an approving nod, then turned to Gwendolyn. "I told you l'd bring my wife today.Anyone gives her trouble, they're taking me on."

His voice was low, but it carried.

Loud enough for everyone in the room to hear.

The words weren't just meant for Gwendolyn.

They were a warning shot to the entire Laurent clan.

Anyone who'd been whispering behind my back a second ago suddenly remembered how to shut up.

A few awkward beats passed before the party resumed its rhytm, the chatter awkward at first, then slowly picking up pace again.

Ashton took my hand and led me to the enormous sofa in the center of the room.

I braced myself for the glares, the barbed questions, the sudden onset of passive aggression.

But instead, everyone smiled.

Some even tried to make it look convincing, though it was obvious they were clenching their molars behind those well-practiced grins.

I'd thought Ashton's (allegedly) illegitimate status would have put him in a precarious spot with the family,but apparently not.

They were treating him like royalty.

No one dared raise their voice, not even Reginald.

Which made me think-if people did suspect our marriage was a sham, would anyone actually have the guts to say it out loud?

Probably not.
So why, exactly, was Ashton still going overboard with all those rehearsals?

It wasn't like we needed to sell the act that hard, but he'd been treating this like some kind of military drill.

Then there was the whole thing about his grandfather, Edouard Laurent.

According to Ashton, the old man was on his deathbed at a nursing home and just wanted to see him get married before he went.

Hence the fake marriage.

Hence the real marriage certificate.

But when I finally saw Edouard, sure, he looked old and a bit frail-he needed a cane-but he didn't seem like he was about to kick the bucket.

His attitude towards me landed somewhere between Reginald and Declan-not overly warm, but not icy either.

Polite. Neutral. Watchful.

Which tracked.

He wasn't like his son, Reginald, who wore every thought on his sleeve like a bad name tag.

Edouard hadn't built an empire by being the type to blurt out anything without weighing it first.

He thanked me for my gift, even complimented my dress-very grandfatherly,very smooth.

If I didn't know any better, I'd have thought he actually liked me.

Then the party got properly underway.

There were speeches, gift-giving, cake-cutting,photo-taking-the whole shebang.

Not long after, Ashton was called into the study by his grandfather.

I was left alone on the sofa, quietly matching names to faces and observing the dynamics of a multi-branch family tree.

I felt it almost immediately-that creeping sensation of being watched.
Not just the polite kind, either.

This was surgical,skin-peeling scrutiny.

I tried to ignore it, but one particular stare coming from my right was doing a fantastic job of making my shoulders lock up.

I turned my head and locked eyes with a woman in the corner.

She wasn't blinking.

Fuck.

Isobel Brooke.

The jolt that went through me was embarrassingly visible-l actually flinched.

Her gaze hadn't changed since high school.

Still that cold, reptilian deadness, like she'd skin me just to see how I was wired.

I shivered.

It wasn't fear.

It was that reflexive revulsion, like when you feel something wet and squishy in your shoe and realize you've just crushed a slug.

When Serenna Oakley mentioned that Isobel was coming back to town, I'd thought, "Skyline's huge. What are the odds we'd ever bump into each other again?"

Yet here we were, not even a few days later, and I was staring straight at her.

I leaned slightly towards the girl next to me-dark hair, barely out of college, tapping away on her phone like she wasin her bedroom instead of at a party.

Ashton had introduced her earlier, but my brain had already dumped her name.

"Who's that?" I asked, keeping my voice casual as I nodded subtly towards Isobel.

She looked up, then followed my line of sight. "Oh. That's Isobel... something. She's with Quentin, Ashton's second uncle's kid. Pretty sure they're getting engaged soon. That's probably why she's here. Y'know,
tagging along as future family."

I looked again.

The way Isobel's eyes had been slicing through me told me everything I needed to know.

Serenna had been right: Isobel still hated my guts.

I exhaled slowly, the walls starting to press in around me like the air had thickened.

Too many people had swarmed me already-chit-chatting, fake-smiling, all trying to suss out one thing:how close was I to Ashton?

And if the answer was "very," could I pull his strings?

Could I be their inside track, their pretty little pawn?

It felt less like a party and more like a networking event, one where ninety percent of the guests shared the same surname.

It was still too early to slip out without raising eyebrows, so I stood, smoothed my dress, and excused myself, saying I needed the loo.

I ducked right, away from the clinking of Baccarat crystal and the nauseating hum of polite small talk, out through a French window into actual air.

The grass under my heels was damp but welcome.

A gaggle of kids were shrieking with joy nearby, running in uncoordinated circles, high on cake and freedom.

Their laughter floated on the breeze like bubbles about to pop.

I passed the pool-glowing turquoise under the garden lights-when someone yelled my full name.

"Mirabelle Vance!"

I stopped dead.

That voice.

I hadn't heard it in years, but it still scraped across my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.
I turned slowly, and there she was, strutting across the lawn.

"Haven't seen you in a long while," Isobel said.

She stopped right in front of me, chin tilted,eyes scanning my face.

"Not long enough," I muttered.

"Surprised to see me?" she asked.

I smiled. "Surprised you're still in one piece. Given that bratty attitude and unfiltered mouth of yours,1figured by now your body would have washed up on a beach in some sketchy port city. Headless."
 ###Chapter 88 Genial Host,Hostile Guest


I tilted my head, smirking at her. "So, how's life abroad been treating you? Since you're back in town, I'm guessing your family decided to un-disown you?"

Isobel's grin wavered, freezing for a heartbeat before she caught herself. "Fine. Not that it's any of your business. FYI, my family treats me like the queen I am."

"Oh, really? Like a queen? That's why they shipped you off with a single suitcase and no return ticket?"

She stomped her heel, but the tip bounced off the concrete by the pool, making her wince.

Then she stepped closer, invading my space. "What are you even doing here?"

"I could ask you the same thing."

"I'm a friend of the Laurents. Engaged to one, actually."

"Oh? I'm married to one."

Everyone with at least one functioning ear must have heard about me and Ashton by now.

Isobel was just being her usual petty, self-important self.

Her eyes flashed.

She stepped in again, and I jabbed a finger toward her chest.

"Don't get any closer. That knockoff Chanel stench is triggering my gag reflex."

She glared but stayed where she was.

"I didn't think you had it in you to snag Ashton Laurent." The sneer might have been fake, but the jealousy in her voice couldn't be hidden. "Damn, girl. Gotta hand it to you. Heard Rhys Granger dumped you, but now I'm thinking it was the other way around. Bet you ditched him for an upgrade."

I didn't answer.

No point dignifying that with a response.
1 always knew you aimed high," she went on. "You never dated in high school. Everyone thought you were just a stuck-up nerd. But I knew better. You weren't wasting that pretty face and perky rack on boys who still lived off theirmum's credit cards. And look where it's got you-married to the golden goose. Must've taken a hell of a lot of effort to get Ashton into bed, huh?"

My patience cracked. "What the hell do you want, Isobel?"

"Nothing major," she said, her tone turning ice-cold. "I just want you to keep your mouth sut."

"About what? About how you ruled the school with your little mean-girl dictatorship? How you got your arse handed to you for weeks after the winter dance and dropped out like a coward?"

Her eyes shot wide. "So you're admitting it! You were the one who jumped me!"

I shrugged. "I admit nothing. Just recapping what everyone at school knew."

"It had to be you!" she hissed. "Only you had-"

"What? A motive? Don't flatter yourself. You made enemies like it was a full-time job. If I lined up everyone who wanted a swing at you, l'd need to rent out a whole city block just to manage the queue."

IsobeI floundered, mouth half open, eyes blazing.

She'd never admit it, but the years abroad must have changed her.

Something had knocked the edges off, sanded down the queen-bitch arrogance.

When she spoke again, her voice was noticeably softer.

"Anyway, I didn't come here to reminisce," she said, trying for a more reasonable tone. "Quentin and I are getting engaged soon. I'm hoping the past can stay in the past, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention..anything to him about me."

"I just might," I said, purely out of spite, though I'd never laid eyes on Quentin before.

Color rose in her cheeks.

Isobel gripped her handbag. "Don't. Please."

"What's in it for me?" I asked, just for the hell of it.

Her eyes widened. "Are you blackmailing me? You want money?" She was part incredulous, part scornful.
"You're married to the richest man in the city-hell, maybe in the country. Why would you need my money?"

"I don't want your money. I want you to go to the police and admit it was you who hired that thug,you who spiked my drink."

"No," she said flatly.

"Then no deal." I turned to walk away.

"Wait!" She scrambled forward a step. "Come on, for old time's sake!"

I looked back over my shoulder. "We don't have old times. And if we did, I should probably kick your arse for them. But lucky for you, I've mellowed with age."

"Come on!" she whined. "I'm not asking you to do anything. I'm literally asking you to NOT do anything."

When I didn't respond, she dropped the sugar-coated act.

"I won't say anything if you don't."

I raised an eyebrow. "What have you even got to say?"

"Plenty."

"Like what?"

"Like how you used to moon over Rhys like some tragic little fangirl. I saw you doodling his name in your sketchpad. Don't even bother denying it." She crossed her arms, her cleavage pushed up and on full display."You wouldn't want your current husband to know you were obsessed with another man,would you?"

I snorted. "Please. Everyone within a hundred-mile radius knew about me and Rhys. Ashton included. If that's your big ace, you're welcome to tell him. See what happens."

The smugness slipped from her face.

She could tell I wasn't bluffing, and panic flickered in her eyes.

"You know," I said casually, twisting the blade just a little, "1wasn't even going to say anything. But the more you beg, the more tempting it becomes. And if you really are marrying Quentin... well, that would make us in-laws of some miserable sort. Imagine having to see you at Christmas dinners. Ugh, no thanks. I'd better go warn Quentin."
"You wouldn't." Her voice dropped an octave, threatening now.

"Wouldn't l?" | stepped towards her. "I don't know what kind of man Quentin is, but I doubt any Laurent would wantto marry a schoolyard bully. A mean girl turned social climber. People don't change, Isobel.Leopards don't sprout stripes. What if you have kids and raise a bunch of little bullies just like Mummy? I'd be doing Quentin a favour."

"Mirabelle Vance!" she snapped. "Don't think that just because you've got Ashton Laurent wrapped around your little finger, I can't hurt you anymore."
###Chapter 89 Old Enemy,New Threat


I stepped into her space. "Oh really? What, you're going to threaten me now? Come on, Isobel. It's 2025, not the Wild West. What's the plan-whack me? You think your precious family's still going to clean up your mess? Still going to bail you out after everything you've done?"

Her face flushed deep red, her breath jagged like she was seconds from bursting a blood vessel.

"Don't talk to me like that!" she hissed, her raised voice drawing attention.

She glanced around, suddenly self-conscious, and lowered her tone. "Fine. How much wouldit take?"

"I told you, I don't want money. I want you to go to the police and confess. Own up to what you did."

"Not gonna happen."

"Then we're done."

I turned and walked off.

It wasn't like I could conjure up a sack, throw it over her head, and pick up where we left off back in high school with a proper beatdown.

Short of that, I was done.

She scrambled after me."Wait!"

Her hand clamped onto my arm.

Stronger grip than I expected.

I backhanded her in the ribs, hard enough to make her wheeze and let go with a winded "oof."

"Ow! You hurt me!" she snarled.

"I'll hurt you worse if you keep following me."

I turned away.

A pair of kids ran past, squealing, inflatable swim rings bouncing around their waists.
I stepped aside to avoid them, my back momentarily to Isobel.

She must've thought that was her moment.

Even without looking, I felt it-the air shift, the sharp clack of her heels against the concrete, the sickly waft of her perfume.

I sidestepped and pivoted.

She lunged straight past me-arms flailing, legs sliding-and crashed towards the swimming pool.

Except I'd mnisjudged.

Didn't shift far enough.

As she flew past, her flailing hand caught the back of my knee and yanked.

"Shit!"

I couldn't stop it.

I pitched forward helplessly, headed straight for the pool.

The water hit me like a wall.

Cold, sharp, punishing.

It slapped against my skin and swallowed me whole.

I sank immediately, the chill biting into my bones.

All sound blurred into muffled silence.

A thrash-Isobel's arm, maybe trying to swim-caught me across the stomach, knocking the breath from my lungs.

Her leg clipped me again, and I was pushed further away, the current scattering us like broken pieces.

I should've been fine.

The pool wasn't deep.

Kids swam here.
But the world tilted.

My vision dimmed at the edges, narrowing like a tunnel.

Panic surged-sudden,irrational, all-consuming.

The kind of fear that didn't care about logic.

My limbs turned to stone.

i couldn't move, couldn't rise.

My arms flailed weakly, but they weren't swimming-they were sinking.

The cold wasn 't just water anymore.

The memory hit me like a brick to the chest.

Years ago. High school.

Sixteen and stupid, still trusting people I shouldn't.

Isobel had lured me to an abandoned building with some thug from off-campus-someone twice my size,reeking of cigarettes and something worse.

I'd wanted to leave.

I tried.

But my head was spinning from the spiked drink someone had handed me earlier.

The bastard reached for me, slurring something, and I knew if I didn't get out, something irreversible would happen.

There'd been a rusted piece of rebar on the floor.

I found it by accident, fingers grazing cold metal.

When he lunged,I swung.

It landed with a sickening thud, and he went down hard.

The back window was loose.
I forced it open.

There was a river below.

I didn't even hesitate. I jumped.

But I couldn't swim.

Not then. Not while I was drunk, disoriented, terrified out of my mind.

The water closed over me, cold and endless.

I kicked, thrashed, screamed-but it all stayed trapped inside.

The sky vanished.

All that existed was the current, swallowing me, choking me.

The taste of dirty water in my mouth.

The weight of my clothes dragging me down.

The realization that no one was coming.

No one knew.

I was utterly alone.

And that old terror-the one I'd buried so deep-slammed into me now like it had never left.

The pool wasn't a pool anymore.

It was that river again.

And I wasn't Mirabelle Vance, the woman who survived.

I was that sixteen-year-old girl again-betrayed,alone, drowning with no one to save her.

My limbs forgot how to move.

My body forgot how to fight.

Panic clamped down like a vise, locking every muscle, scrambling every thought.
I didn't know which way was up.

My vision blurred.

My chest burned.

My lungs convulsed, desperate for air.

My mouth opened, and water rushed in, cold and vicious.

The edges of my mind flickered, like a dying lightbulb.

Then-something.

A figure, slicing through the water.

I couldn't tell if it was real or just my brain giving me something beautiful to die to.

A hallucination. A ghost.

But it was coming straight for me. Fast, purposeful, unstoppable.

My mouth opened again, but this time not for air.

Maybe for help. Maybe for a name.

Nothing came out.

Then-arms. Solid. Real.

One wrapped tight around my waist, anchoring me.

That was when I knew it wasn't a dream, wasn't a trick ofthe light or some fading fantasy.

And the moment that truth registered,my body gave out.

Everything went black.
 ###Chapter 90 Drowning


Ashton had never sprinted that fast in his life.

Still, by the time he dragged Mirabelle out of the water, her lips were blue,her body limp in his arms.

He had been too fucking slow.

He knew it the moment her head lolled back and she didn't open her eyes.

He laid her down on the poolside tiles, soaking wet and ice-cold.

He tilted her head, checked her airway, locked his hands over her sternum, and began to pump.

Fast.Hard.

A sick, ugly rhythm that scared the hell out of him.

Then mouth-to-mouth-his breath into hers, again and again, his heart hammering so loud it drowned out everything else.

Come on,Mirabelle.

Finally,she jerked.

Coughed.

Water poured from her mouth, splattering against his chest.

Her eyes stayed shut, but her breathing started.

Shallow, ragged-each gasp as if it hurt.

Ashton scooped her up, holding her tight against him, and tore back into the house.

The party noise hit him like a slap-laughing, music, chatter.

He didn't slow down.

He took the stairs three at a time, ignoring the stunned faces and dropped glasses.
Every head turned.

Every mouth hung open.

But no one stopped him.

Maids scrambled behind him, their arms loaded with towels and blankets.

Ashton kicked open his bedroom door.

He laid her down carefully on the bed, the thick duvet pulled around her, tucking her in tight.

She looked so small, trembling like a leaf.

Her dress was soaked through, plastered to her skin.

The silk shawl was a soggy tangle, knotted at her elbow.

Ashton wrapped his arms around her, blanket and all, pulling her against his chest.

"More blankets!" he barked. "Get the shower on. Full heat."

Mirabelle's eyelids fluttered like she was caught in a nightmare.

Her breaths came in short bursts, her mouth half-open.

He touched her face.

Ice.

His own hands weren't exactly warm either.

"Mirabelle," he said quietly, leaning close. "Mirabelle, can you hear me?"

Nothing.

Not even a twitch.

"Mr. Laurent, the bath's ready!" a maid called from the doorway.

Ashton lifted Mirabelle again, cradling her like a baby, and strode into the en suite.

Steam billowed from the tub.
He stepped straight in, shoes and all, then knelt and lowered her into the water, still fully clothed.

The second her skin hit the water, she lost it.

"No! No!" she thrashed like she was being electrocuted, her nails digging into his forearm.

"Shh. Shh, Mirabelle, it's me. It's not the pool.You're safe."

She fought harder, slippery and fast, her elbow smashing into his chest so hard he staggered.

The breath was punched out of him.

Jesus.He hadn't realized she could hit like that.

"Mirabelle," he said, dragging her into his lap, one arm locking around her ribs as he pulled her back from the water.

She clung to him like she'd drown if she let go.

His gut tightened.

He'd seen people in shock, but this was something else.

He cupped her cheeks. "Talk to me, Mirabelle. What's going on?"

Her eyes flicked wildly, not quite focusing.

She looked like she was stuck in something he couldn't see.

For a second, he didn't move.

Couldn't.

Every instinct screamed at him to fix it, but he didn't know what the hell he was fighting.

He picked her up again and carried her back to the bed.

She shivered the whole way, silent, small.

As soon as her body touched the mattress, some of the tension eased from her limbs.

Not much. But enough.
A faint sound slipped from her lips-a low, broken moan.

Ashton didn't think she knew she'd made it.

He felt it more than heard it.

It cut straight through him.

He pulled her closer.

Not tight enough to hurt, just enough to make sure she knew she wasn't alone.

Her lashes flickered, and her eyes blinked open-clouded,confused,distant.

He held her face, his thumb brushing her cheek.

His voice softened.

"Mirabelle.What happened?"

She shook her head,barely.

Her hand clutched at his sleeve.

"Someone... someone dragged me in.." Her voice trembled, words slurring, breath short. "It was Brooke..."


His blood turned to ice.

He hadn't caught most of it, just the name.

He curled his hand around her shoulder, firm enough to anchor her.

"Look at me." His voice was calm, but iron-threaded. "Say it again. What did she do?"

She mumbled something broken, a rasp more than a sentence, trembling harder in his arms.

Her mind was slipping fast, like she was underwater and drifting deeper every second.

Ashton recalled what he'd seen earlier.

Saving Mirabelle from drowning had been his only thought.

But now that the panic was ebbing, he remembered there had been someone else.
A woman, climbing up from the other end of the pool.

He hadn't spared her a second glance at the time.

"Mr. Laurent?" a maid's soft voice broke through the haze behind him.

She was holding a stack of neatly folded clothes. "Should we help Mrs. Laurent change into something dry?"

Ashton stood. "Give me the clothes."

The maid hesitated but handed them over.

"Leave the room."

Everyone cleared out.

Ashton crouched down beside the bed and gently pulled away the duvet.

The white dress clung to her body like a second skin, soaked through, transparent in all thewrong places.

He pulled one of the thick towels off the chair and wrapped it around her shoulders.

"Mirabelle," he said softly, brushing a wet strand of hair from her cheek. "I need to get you dry. You're safe now. It's me. Ashton."

She flinched when he tugged at the zipper on her dress, a feeble jerk that didn't last.

Her fingers gripped his wrist for a second, then let go, as if recognizing his touch.

"You're safe now," he murmured again. "It's just me."

He peeled the dress off, slowly,carefully.

Her skin was cold and slick, goosebumps running up her arms.

He draped the first towel over her and started drying her off, using slow circular movements, paying attention to her limbs, her back, her neck.

She didn't protest, not really.

She just shivered, her chest rising and falling like she couldn't quite settle into her own body.
hen came the bra and panties.

Ashton hesitated, the towel paused midair.
 ###Chapter 91 Ashton's POV: Not Fast Enough


Her bra and panties were soaked through.

Not a good idea to leave them on.

Mirabelle squirmed when he reached for the bra clasp, but his voice cut through the fog again-low, steady,close to her ear.

"It's me. Ashton.You're safe now."

Her breath hitched, then she went still.

He stripped off the last of the soaked fabric, toweled her off again, and reached for the change of clothes.

A white dress shirt and suit trousers, both at least two sizes too big.

They were his.

There wvere women in the house-his brother's wife, his stepmother-but the idea of Mirabelle wearing anything of theirs made something primal crawl under his skin.

He slipped the shirt over her shoulders, buttoned it up, rolled the cuffs.

The trousers he folded at the waist and cinched loosely with one of his ties.

She looked like she'd wandered out of his closet half-asleep, hair damp, skin flushed, drowning in layers of fabric.

Her eyes were barely open.

She was somewhere else entirely.

Ashton stood and shifted his weight, running a hand over his collar like it was strangling him.

His own suit was drenched and clinging to him, but he didn't care.

Eventually, Mirabelle's breathing began to even out.

Her lashes stopped twitching.
She wasn't shivering as much.

He stayed.

A maid returned with a hairdryer.

Ashton took it, set it to the lowest and least noisy setting, and gently worked through her hair with his fingers as the warm air blew softly.

Mirabelle didn't let go of his shirt the entire time, her hand clenched in the fabric.

A knock.

Another maid stepped in, balancing a tray.

"Here's the hot chocolate you asked for, Mr.Laurent."

"Leave it on the table."

He stayed by her side, her fingers still twisted in his shirt, murmuring to her under his breath. Over and over.

"You're safe."

"I'm here."

"You're safe now."

Gradually, her shivering stopped.

She curled into the blanket he'd tucked around her and didn't move.

Ashton stood, eyes scanning her face.

She looked young like this. Defenseless.

Barely recognizable as the woman who'd once dragged him off a bar stool and hauled him into the nearest hotel room.

He turned to the maid. "Stay with her. If she wakes up, get her anything she asks for. And inform me immediately."

"Yes,Mr.Laurent."
He lingered for a second longer, then walked out.

In another room, he changed into a fresh suit.

Pausing at the top of the staircase landing, he surveyed the crowd below.

Quentin was flapping a towel.uselessly around a woman, who sat on a sofa, dripping, face pale.

She had clearly taken a dip.

Hair soaked, dress plastered to her skin, mascara running down in tiny rivulets.

But otherwise, her breathing was easy, her eyes clear, her voice functional.

Ashton stepped into the living room.

The crowd silenced instantly, then shifted, parting without being asked.

Isobel stood up immediately, her spine snapping straight, an automatic response of most people when they met Ashton face to face for the first time.

"Mr. Laurent," she said with wide eyes and forced concern, "how's Mirabelle? I hope she's okay."

"She's resting." His tone could have iced a cocktail."What happened?"

She repeated the little monologue she'd just fed the others-high school, old friends, catching up, slippery tiles.

"She must've panicked," Isobel added, wringing her fingers. "When she slipped, she just grabbed for me.I don't think she even realized it."

Quentin eased forward gingerly. "Ashton, um, can l use one of the rooms upstairs? Isobel's soaked through.She's freezing. I want her to change into something dry."

Ashton didn't look at him. "Just a second."

Then he pivoted back to the star of the sob story.

"You're telling me Mirabelle pulled you into the water?"

Isobel blinked rapidly.
Her lips parted, but no sound came out.

A second too long passed.

She gave an involuntary shudder, this time not from the cold.

"I mean... I guess she did, sort of. She was probably just startled. I'm sure it wasn't intentional."

Her eyes slid away.

Ashton's fingers twitched.

The urge to physically drag the truth out of her was visceral.

He didn't, of course.

But it sat there, humming under his skin like static.

Without Mirabelle here, Isobel must have thought she could spin whatever tale she liked.

And maybe with someone else, it would have worked.

But Ashton trusted Mirabelle.

Even if she'd been half-drowned and half-delirious, he trusted her more than he'd ever trust a stranger wrapped in a damp towel and bad acting.

"Are you sure that's what happened?" he asked, giving her one last chance to come clean.

Isobel missed it completely.

Her fingers clutched at the terry cloth. "Yeah, I think so. I mean, it all happened so fast..."

"If I pull the surveillance footage, will it back up your version?" Ashton asked.

She didn't know the cameras had been turned off at the request of a few privacy-obsessed guests.

And Ashton wasn't about to enlighten her.

Panic flashed in her eyes.

Isobel turned to Quentin with a desperate look.
He ventured, "Ashton, why don't we deal with this later, yeah? Let's get Isobel upstairs before she catches pneumonia."

"She can leave when she answers the question," Ashton said flatly.

His eyes never left her face.

"Will the tape back you up? Or not?"

She blinked.Fast.

HHe could almost see the internal map in her mind, scrambling to remember where the cameras were.

He didn't fill the silence.

Just stared.

She buckled.

Not visibly.

But he saw it.

The flinch behind the eyes.

The slight hitch in her breath.

He stepped forward.

Only a fraction.

Twenty centimeters, maybe.

But it was enough.

Isobel jolted like she'd been shocked, stumbled back onto the sofa without meaning to.

Her throat worked around words that never made it out.

Quentin dropped into a crouch beside her, resting one hand on her shoulder.

Even he looked uneasy now.
"Come on, honey," he said, voice a notch too high."Just tell Ashton what you saw, then we can go get you changed."

Isobel licked her lips.

A small voice piped up from the far side of the room.

"I saw what happened!"
###Chapter 92 Ashton's POV: Confrontation


The voice was high-pitched, clear.

It sliced through the tension like someone had just popped a balloon in a silent church.

Ashton's head snapped around.

The kid couldn't have been more than seven.

She wore a daffodil-yellow dress speckled with tiny white blossoms and had pigtails so neatly braided they looked vacuum-sealed.

She looked right back at him, completely unbothered by the fact that every single adult was now gaping at her.

A woman bolted to her side and slapped a hand gently over the girl's mouth.

"Don't talk nonsense, Freya," the woman hissed, frantic. "You don't know anything."

She forced a shaky smile in Ashton's direction. "She's just a kid. She doesn't understand-"

"Let her finish," Ashton said.

The woman's lips kept twitching like she wanted to protest, but all she could do was shut up and move to the side.

Freya jabbed a finger straight at Isobel.

"I was playing out back just now. I saw you talking to that pretty lady, but she didn't wanna talk to you. She tried to leave, and you chased her. Then you slipped and fell into the pool, and you dragged her in with you.You lied!"

Isobel blanched.

Quentin's jaw dropped. "What? Isobel, is that true?"

She forced a shaky smile. "Of course it's not. She's just a kid. You know how kids are-they love making things up."
Quentin seized on that like a drowning man to a rope. "Exactly. She's six. She doesn't know what she's saying!"

Freya's eyes burned. "I saw it!”

She whipped off her tiny crossbody bag, unzipped it with furious little hands, and pulled out a yellow phone covered in sparkly stickers.

"I was filming a puppy in the yard and caught the whole thing by accident! Look!"

"What?" Isobel's voice turned strangled.

Ashton held out his hand.

Freya handed over the phone obediently.

Silence swallowed the room as Ashton watched the video.

Center screen: a playful Golden Retriever puppy.

Top right corner: two figures.

Mirabelle with her back turned.

Isobel lunging.

A sidestep.

A slip.

Isobel's hand latching onto Mirabelle's leg mid-fall.

Both went under.

Ashton played it again.

Then he held up the phone to Isobel's face, pausing on the exact frame of her grabbing Mirabelle.

"Got anything to say for yourself?"

Isobel's throat bobbed.

Her mouth opened.
Closed.

Opened again.

Quentin rushed in before she could. "Ashton, I didn't know, I swear. I just believed whatever she told me-"

"I panicked!" Isobel blurted, her voice shrill and pitched high. "It happened so fast-l might've tripped-I don't remember exactly. Mirabelle was beside me, I just... reacted! It was instinct! I didn't mean to drag her in, I swear-"

The lies tumbled out, quick and panicked.

"A moment ago, you stood here and made everyone believe Mirabelle pulled you in. I gave you the chance to tell the truth. You didn't take it. Not until the video exposed you."

Around them, the crowd collectively stopped breathing.

More than a few had been on the receiving end of that tone before-Ashton's calm, cold finality.

The tone of a man delivering final judgment with no reprieve, no appeal.

Isobel stood frozen, mascara beginning to crust at the corners of her eyes.

She turned to Quentin, clutching his hand.

Quentin looked at her, confusion, betrayal, disbelief, irritation, all fighting for space on his face.

Then he glanced at Ashton.

Rock.Hard place.

But he never got the chance to choose.

A man and a woman stepped out from the crowd.

The woman's voice was brisk, clipped. "She has nothing to do with Quentin."

"Mum!" Quentin choked.

"Shut up!" she snapped, then turned to Ashton, voice quivering with both fear and urgency. "She's been playing us all!"
The man yanked Quentin away from Isobel, gripping his arm tight. "You're done with her."

"Quentin broke up with her," his mother added quickly. "Didn't you, Quentin? She's nothing to do with us anymore!"

Their words had no effect on Ashton.

His gaze flicked to Quentin, then to his parents.

"If you hadn't brought her here, none of this would've happened. She's the culprit. You're the accomplices."

Quentin's mother blanched at the implication.

She stormed up to Isobel and slapped her hard across the face.

"You troublemaker," she spat. "You dragged us into this mess. Now apologize to Ashton!"

She glanced back at Ashton, seeking approval.

He gave her nothing.

The slap jolted Isobel out of her daze.

She blinked, dazed, struggling to process.

"I'm sorry," she stammered. "It's all my fault, I... I wasn't thinking-"

"My wife nearly drowned. And you think a 'sorry' will cut it?"

Isobel's mouth opened, but the words were tangled in her throat.

Then came another slap, sharp and stinging, landing on the back of her head.

Quentin's mother snarled. "Try again! Say it like you mean it!"

Tears welled in Isobel's eyes. "I swear, I'm sorry. I was wrong-"

Still, Ashton said nothing.

Quentin exchanged a desperate look with his parents.

They could feel it-Ashton wanted more.
But what?

With a tense breath, Quentin clenched his jaw, then kicked Isobel in the shin.

"Get on your knees. Apologize to my cousin properly."

Isobel gasped,eyes wide with shock."Quentin!"

"Just do it!"

Quentin glanced at Ashton, who was still stone-faced.

He kicked her again, harder this time, square in the back.

Isobel crumpled, crashing to the floor with a sick thud.

Her knees scraped against the cold marble, breath knocked from her lungs.

She stayed there a moment, hunched and shaking.

Then, slowly, she pushed herself up to sit, trembling, slumped and disheveled.

Ashton's towering frame loomed above her.

From where she knelt, he seemed a mile high.

Isobel clenched her fists, nails digging into her thigh.

"I'm sorry." She stared at the floor. "I shouldn't have pushed Mirabelle. It was stupid. It was wrong. l..."

She hesitated, then raised a shaking hand.

And slapped herself across the face.

Once.

Twice.

Her skin reddened.

Each strike cracked through the silence like a gunshot.

Ashton scowled.
None of this came close to atoning for what Mirabelle had endured.

The fire that had erupted in his chest the moment he saw Mirabelle half-submerged and gasping-it hadn't gone out.

The fury that had built, second by second, as he listened to her broken voice, watched her struggle to speak, to move-none of it had eased.

A couple of self-inflicted slaps and a stammered apology?

Not nearly enough.

Mirabelle had almost died.

His eyes drilled into Quentin.

If he hadn't brought Isobel to the party-

A maid rushed downstairs, breathless.

"Mr. Laurent! It's Mrs. Laurent, she-
###Chapter 93 Ashton's POV: Punishment


Ashton was already moving before the maid had finished speaking.

He took the stairs four at a time and reached the second floor in a matter of seconds.

Not stopping to catch his breath, he shoved open the bedroom door.

Mirabelle was buried under a pile of thick duvets, her face flushed scarlet.

Her skin had been bloodless just half an hour ago, ghost-pale and ice-cold after she'd nearly drowned.

Now she looked like she was overheating from the inside out.

Her eyes were screwed tightly shut.

"She started heating up a while ago," the maid behind him stammered."1got a thermometer and... it's forty degrees and climbing."

Ashton strode over and pressed the back of his hand to her cheek.

She wasn't just burning up; her skin was scalding.

He just picked her up-duvet and all-cradled her to his chest, and turned on his heel.

"Hospital.Now."

Downstairs, the room buzzed with shocked whispers, but Ashton barely registered them.

He swept through the hallway, his footsteps thudding over the marble floor, and vanished through the front doors without sparing a glance back.

The driver had already pulled up.

Ashton slid, into the back seat with Mirabelle in his arms, and the car peeled off a moment later, tires screeching faintly against the cobblestones.

Inside the mansion, the stunned silence didn't last.

"He left? Just like that?" someone whispered.
"It's the old Mr. Laurent's birthday, for God's sake. Ashton's the head of the family. What happens to the party now?"

"The old man's still here. The show must go on,right?"

In the middle of the chaos, Isobel was still kneeling on the floor like some half-forgotten prop.

No one knew what to do with her.

No one wanted to be the first to ask.

Then the sound of a cane hitting the floor snapped through the chatter.

Edouard Laurent appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression thunderous.

He thumped the cane once more for effect.

"Enough. All this noise. What are you, chickens in a bloody coup?"

Even now, even retired, even half out of the family business, the old man's presence sucked the air out of the room.

He scowled, muttering under his breath. "Finally get the family together, and that ungrateful brat walks out in the middle of it. The boy clearly doesn't give a damn what this old man thinks."

Next to him, Declan shrugged his shoulders. "Not his fault, Pop. Blame Quentin's psycho girlfriend. She started it. Big bro's not gonna sit through dinner while his girl's dying of a fever or whatever."

Edouard's expression darkened.

He knew Ashton wasn't the problem.

But ditching a family event for a woman chafed at his pride.

His gaze landed on the wreck still kneeling on the floor.

"You think this is a bloody street market?" he barked. "Dragging strays into the ancestral home like it's a bloody dog shelter?"

Quentin's mother paled.

She looked like she might throw up or faint.
"I'm sorry, Uncle Edouard. I... We'll get her out of here immediately!"

She lunged forward and snatched Isobel's arm. "Get up! You're humiliating all of us!"

Isobel said nothing.

Her face was a raw, streaked mess of mascara and blood, smeared from where she'd slapped herself until her skin cracked.

Her designer heels had snapped.

Her dress clung, damp and crumpled.

She didn't react to the shouting or the shoving.

Edouard slammed his cane again, loud enough to make the crystal chandelier rattle."All of you-out!"

Quentin and his parents froze for half a second.

Then bolted.

Quentin grabbed Isobel by the elbow, dragging her limpform out the double doors like luggage with a broken handle.

***

Inside the back of the Rolls, Mirabelle was wrapped so tightly in a duvet she looked half-mummified, but her body still shuddered like she'd been left outside in a blizzard.

"Faster," Ashton barked at the driver.

Mirabelle's hand was a limp, burning thing in his.

Ashton hated how light it felt. Hated the tremble in her jaw, the way her teeth tapped faintly behind her lips.

His chest felt like someone had cinched a steel cable around it and started cranking.

He brushed the back of his fingers against her cheek.

Her skin pulsed with heat.

"You afraid of water?" he asked, quiet now, the way he only ever spoke when it was her.
She wasn't fully out.

Her eyes were closed, lashes clumped from the pool water, but her lips moved.

"Scared...yeah..."

Ashton pulled her closer until her forehead nudged the hollow beneath his collarbone.

"Why?"

She mumbled, slow like her brain was lagging a few seconds behind, the fever turning her words sticky.

"Drowned... once. In high school."

Ashton stilled.

She shifted against him, instinctively curling into his body, cooler than hers.

Her cheek pressed against his chest.

Through the duvet, he felt her soft curves, the fine tremble of her ribs with every breath.

She smelled like chlorine and hot chocolate.

He touched her face again.

Still boiling.

His palm hovered for a second before settling on her cheekbone, gentle.

"Was Isobel Brooke there? Back in high school?"

Mirabelle's brow furrowed like someone had tugged at a dream she didn't want to look at.

"Yeah...yeah,she was..."

Ashton's expression iced over. "She pushed you in?"

"No..." Mirabelle blinked slowly.

Her pupils barely tracked.

She was trying to remember, her face scrunched up with the effort.
Ashton stroked her arm. "It's okay. Never mind that now. Don't talk. Don't think."

"Where...we going?"

"To the hospital."

She frowned. "Don't like...hospitals."

He wanted to ask why not, but Mirabelle had already drifted somewhere else.

In broken fragments-half-formed, jumbled, slurred-she started mumbling into his chest.

He had to tilt his head down, almost press his ear to her lips just to catch it.

Bits and pieces slipped out: Isobel. The drink. The creep waiting for her at some derelict building.

And then the worst part-almost drowning in that river, her lungs full of water, no one to help.

Ashton listened, his face carved from stone.

He regretted it now, regretted not breaking his own rule about not laying a hand on a woman, not even one like Isobel.

He should've done it.

Should've put her on the ground back at that party when he hadthe chance.

His thoughts spiraled, darker by the second, veering into places he usually kept chained up and buried deep.

Until the sharp wail of anambulance siren cut through, snapping him back.
###Chapter 94 Ashton's POV: Fever


"Sir, we're here," the driver said.

Fifteen minutes later...

The private hospital room was silent except for the slow drip-drip-drip of the IV.

Ashton stayed beside the bed, adjusting the blanket over Mirabelle's shoulder.

Her face was flushed. Her hair stuck to her forehead in damp clumps.

He pulled out his phone and made a call.

Yvaine Carlisle sprinted in almost an hour later, panting, sweat clinging to her temples.

She nearly slammed into the doorframe.

"What the hell happened? Why's she burning up?"

Mirabelle was asleep, breathing unevenly.

Ashton pointed his chin toward the sitting area. His voice dropped. "She fell in the pool. Fever spiked after we got her out."

"She fell?" Yvaine had dropped onto the sofa. She now shot back up like the cushion had bitten her. "She's terrified of water. That must've scared the shit out of her."

Ashton narrowed his eyes. "You knew that?"

He'd heard the story from Mirabelle in the car, but her words were disjointed, and there were missing pieces.

He hadn't pushed her, but he wanted the full story now.

Yvaine folded her arms. "Yeah. She's fine with baths and stuff, but she can't swim. I mean, she can,but she doesn't like it. She freezes up near deep water." She glanced back toward the bed. "How the fuck did she end up in the pool?"
"Isobel Brooke yanked her in."

Yvaine's face darkened fast. She jumped to her feet again. "That bitch's back in Skyline?"

She shoved her sleeves up to her elbows. "Where is she?"

"Sit down." Ashton's voice sharpened. "You're going to tell me exactly what happened back then. I'll take care of Isobel."

Yvaine stared at him.

He stared back.

"Fine," she said a minute later, having lost the staring contest. "Mirabelle and I grew up together. But I got shipped off to Europe for high school. I wasn't around when Isobel started that bullying crap. Mirabelle told me later."

She laid it all out. Names. Incidents. The kind of details that made Ashton's jaw twitch.

It matched what Mirabele had said earlier-same story, just clearer and ten times nastier.

Halfway through, Yvaine got so wound up she grabbed the water glass from the table and downed two big gulps like she'd been yelling.

"It was straight-up bullying. No question about it. And it wasn't just Mirabelle. Isobel went after anyone who wouldn't kiss her arse. Everyone knew. But no one did shit. Mirabelle's parents took thirty grand and settled out of court. No charges. Just swept it under the rug."

She slammed the glass down. Water sloshed over the rim.

"And don't tell me it was about the money-they didn't need it. They had business ties with the Brookes. Just didn't want to rock the boat. They treated her like she didn't matter. She never saw a cent of that payout.Not one damn dollar. Her parents are scum. But what could she do? She was just a kid back then."

Her voice cracked. She wiped her cheek with the back of her hand like she didn't want him to see.

Ashton reached across the table and nudged the tissue box closer. "Her family treated her like shit. Do you know why?"

Yvaine's tears vanished on cue. Her voice jumped an octave.
"Treated her like shit? Try worse than a stray. Those two clowns go around in public playing happy family,acting like they dote on all their kids equally. Bullshit. Behind closed doors, they treated Mirabelle like the family's live-in help. Actually, scratch that-they were nicer to their cleanig staff."

She spat the names out like they tasted foul.

"Franklin Vance kept his distance. Always 'busy with work,' like that excused him. Caroline Vance pampered Catherine like she shat gold, and whatever little affection she had left went straight to her precious niece,Serenna Oakley. Meanwhile, Mirabelle got scraps-if that."

Yvaine shook her head,furious.

Then she answered Ashton's unspoken question: "I've said it before-they must've swapped babies at the hospital. It's the only thing that makes sense. No decent parent treats their own kid like that. I even told Mirabelle to grab some of Frank and Caroline's hair for a secret DNA test, but she wouldn't do it. I let it go."She shrugged. "Maybe it's easier not knowing."

Ashton didn't respond. His eyes stayed on the water glass Yvaine had slammed down earlier and imagined it was Frank and Caroline's faces.

Yvaine sighed.

"You've no idea how much she put up with. She took up boxing just so she could defend herself. And that skank Isobel Brooke? Still has the balls to show her face back in Skyline. I hope karma parks itself on her doorstep."

Ashton's ears buzzed. Yvaine kept talking, but he couldn't hear her anymore.

She left at some point, and the room fell into dead silence.

Eventually, he moved.

Mirabelle lay still, buried under the white duvet.

Her face had lost its flush-skin pale, mouth slack, dark lashes against her cheeks.

Ashton stepped closer and touched her cheek.

Her skin felt cool again.

He bent down and kissed her forehead.
Then he climbed into the bed, pulled her against his chest, wrapped an arm around her waist, and closed his eyes.

Something tugged at him. Pressure against his chest. He blinked awake.

The room was dark. The light from the corridor sliced in under the door, but didn't reach the bed.

His back was stiff from the way he'd been lying.

Mirabelle was half on top of him now, her forehead pressed to the base of his throat.

The IV needle had been removed at some point; there was a faint red mark on the back of her hand where it used to be.

That same hand was now curled into his shirtfront, fingers twitching like she was searching for something.

She kept shifting, restless, her body twisting against his like her clothes were irritating her skin.

Her breathing was uneven. Her forehead and cheeks were damp. Sweat had soaked through her collar.Her eyes were still shut, lashes clamped tight. Her mouth was drawn.Tense.

The heat coming off her was worse than before.
###Chapter 95 Ashton's POV: Things He Didn't Know


I floated.

Not in water. Not anymore.

But my limbs felt loose, weightless, like gravity had forgotten me.

I drifted in and out of sleep, memories slipping through the cracks.

Ashton's arms. The sting of pool water against my skin.

A towel.A bed.Sleep. But not for long.

Then the blur of movement-his chest under my cheek, the lurch of a car.

I was somewhere else after that. Multiple voices, hands on my forehead and wrist, an electronic beep,receding footsteps, then a different kind of quiet. Cooler air. Sterile, sharp.

A hospital. I knew the smell.

At some point, something slid into my arm. A tube. IV fluid dripping, seeping into my bloodstream.

Cold trickled in. I shivered in relief.

There were voices again. One of them soft, tight with worry.

Yvaine? Maybe. I couldn't hold onto it long enough to be sure.

Then sleep again. Real this time. Deep. Still.

My body sank, just for a moment.

But peace didn't last.

Something inside me stirred.

A flicker at first.

Then a steady burn, crawling under my skin like lava waking up.
The heat was back.

Every breath stung.

The pillow was wet. The sheet stuck to my spine.

I clawed at the fabric near my collarbone, yanked it down, but it wasn't enough.

I needed cool.

Something moved beside me.Weight shifted. Air brushed my arm.

I heard the electronic beep of a thermometer, then a damp towel draped over my forehead.

I reached.Found a chest. Solid, broad, warm, but not scorching. The shirt was soft with wear.

I grabbed it and pulled.

He tried to rise.

"It's okay, Mira. I'm not leaving. Just going to the bathroom."

I made a guttural sound. My arm locked around his middle. Yanked.

He stayed.

I pressed my cheek to his chest. His heartbeat thumped, steady.

The surface of his skin felt cooler than mine.

But not cool enough.

I dragged my face lower, across the fabric, searching for more coolness.

My fingers popped a button.

His hand caught my wrist."Mira."

I kept going.

Another button gone.

Skin. Cooler there. I pressed my mouth to it.
He twitched. His stomach rose under my lips.

I stayed there, inhaling. Laundry soap. Salt. The faint scent of sweat.

My leg hooked around his hip. My thigh slid against him.

His breath changed. Slower. Rougher.

I pulled the rest of the shirt free, shoved it aside.

My hands spread over his chest, mapping the shape of him. Smooth skin, soft hair.

My palms moved with purpose, flattening, roaming, learning him.

He groaned.

I shifted again, rubbing my face over his chest, tracing the dips and contours.

Found cooler patches and chased them.

Beneath his collarbone. Along his ribs. Down to his navel. Pressed my cheek there.

He jerked. His thigh tensed under mine.

My fingers slid under the waistband of his trousers, searching for the line between warm and cool.

There was a shape.Rounded, soft. Definitely not cold.

A grunt. "Mira!" His hand gripped my shoulder and dragged my face away.

Another hand threw a blanket over me.

I kicked it off the bed. Air hit my skin.Better.

Any time I felt fabric-shirt, sheet, waistband-I shoved it aside. Too hot. It held the heat like insulation.I wanted none of it.

I yanked at his trousers. Tugged at mine. Anything that clung to skin, I fought off.

He caught my wrist again, this time laughing under his breath.

"Much as I'd like to see you naked, this is a hospital."
I didn't care.I growled.Clung tighter.

Then he left. The bed shifted, his weight gone.

A huff escaped my throat. I struggled to open my eyes, but my eyelids weighed a ton.

Then cool pressed to my forehead. Damp. Soft. A towel or ice pack.

Relief hit like a gust of wind.

I let myseIf sink into the mattress. Muscles unknotted.

He climbed in behind me, his arm sneaking around my waist. Warm again.Heavy.

I shoved at his chest, annoyed. I wanted the cold, not the furnace of his body.

He paused. Didn't move. Then pulled back. The mattress lifted slightly.

He muttered something. I didn't catch the words.

Two more ice packs later, the coolness settled my skin. My breathing evened out. My head stopped throbbing.

But the human blanket came back and was heating me uup again. His chest, his arms-too warm.

My skin started to prickle. I squirmed. My thigh rubbed against his. Still too hot.

I tried to slide out of his hold.

His arm clamped around my waist like a seatbelt.

I whimpered under my breath. Pushed at his chest.

No use.

I tried twisting, rolling.

Nothing changed.

Half my body slid off the mattress before he pulled me back in with one swift tug.

"Careful," he muttered, his voice thick with sleep.
I might have glared. Maybe I just imagined it.

"Too hot," I complained.

Silence, then the weight shifted. He rolled away. The bed dipped. Rose.

Air filled the space he used to occupy.

I clutched the ice pack and didn't move.

Hte said something, maybe an oath.

Then he was gone.

His weight left the bed, but his scent lingered.
###Chapter 96 Fever


Ashton was about to explode.

His skin ran cooler than hers-that was the whole reason she'd latched onto him in the first place.

But the coolness didn't last long.

The moment her lips brushed his skin, heat shot through his core like a flare. His chest tightened, ribs compressing as if his lungs had shrunk.

She was doing unspeakable things to his shirt, tugging and clawing at the fabric with the same feverish impatience she'd shown that night at the hotel.

Apparently, she had a habit of tearing buttons off when she didn't feel like undoing them one by one.

His throat was dry as sand. Forming words was a challenge he had no time for.

At first, he had tried to behave.

She was feverish. Burning up. Maybe even delirious.

Someone had to be the adult in the room.

But it was getting harder by the second.

Every time she whimpered in that breathy, unsatisfied way when he edged away, every time her mouth ghosted over his chest or her cheek dragged across his stomach, another bolt of heat tore through him.

Her breath hit his skin-wet,warm, careless-and he nearly flinched.

He didn't move. He couldn't.

He kept his arms locked around her like a brace, holding himself several decent inches away.

Then her nose bumped his belt. Her cheek landed squarely against the swollen bulge straining in his trousers.

Ashton swore under his breath.
He caught her tace In both hands and gently, firmly, pushed it away.

He shifted, angling himself so that the tent in his pants was no longer aimed at her flushed, inquisitive face.

But she kept coming, tearing through fabric like it offended her.

He nearly gave in.

His eyes darted to the door, then back to her fevered cheeks, then to the door again.

"Fuck."

He pried her off, untangling her octopus-like limbs, and stood up to grab the ice packs from the medical cart.

The cold hit his fingers first-blessed, numbing relief. He pressed a pack to her skin.

It worked. Gradually, she quieted. Her limbs stilled. Her breathing slowed.

His didn't.

He forced air through his nose, slow and shallow, trying to quash the fire crawlng up his spine.

Trying not to stare at the loose gown slipping off her shoulder, revealing smooth, bare skin and the soft curve of her back.


She was sick. She didn't know what she was doing.

HHe didn't have that excuse.

Still, his body had turned traitor. Heat poured off him, sweat gathering uunder his collar. It felt like he was getting a fever of his own.

She noticed first. Her eyes fluttered open, unfocused. She made a small,irritated sound and shoved at his chest with both hands.

"Hot.Go away."

She rolled to the edge of the bed, kicking off the covers.

He reached out before she could fall. "Careful."
His hand wrapped around her waist and hauled her back, anchoring her against his side.

She kept squirming, arms and legs flailing in slow motion, fists thumping against his ribs.

Her face scrunched, eyes pinched shut, mouth turned into a pout. She smacked at him like a sulky foddler.

None of #t hurt. She didn't have the strength for that.

He sighed and let her go.

Standing, he replaced the melting ice pack on her forehead with a fresh one, then pointed the infrared thermometer at her temple.

The reading blinked back at him-her fever was starting to drop.

Her Tace crumpled with irritation every time he tried to get close. If he sat on the edge of the bed or reached for her hand, she jerked or rolled away.

Now that she had the real ice packs, it seemed she no longer needed the human-sized one.

Ashton left the room, easing the door shut behind him.

He crossed the suite, went straight for the windows, and shoved them all open.

Cold air crashed into the room. Wind tore through his hair and slapped against his bare skin, reminding him just how shirtless he was.

He pulled out his phone and dialed Dominic Everett.

"Dig up everything you can on Isobel Brooke," he said as soon as the line picked up. "Back to her school days.Bullying, assault-whatever she's got buried, I want it. Find the proof. Find the people. And lean on the Brooke family's businesses. Quiet pressure. Make them sweat."

It was past two in the morning, but Dominic sounded wide awake and alert.

"Got it, boss. I'll start now."

"Where's Quentin Laurent working?"

"Admin at Laurent Logistics Management. Desk job."

"Transfer him."
"Where to?

"Ulaanbaatar."

A pause, then: "Understood. We've got a system implementation project there. He'l oversee it. Timeline's three years."

"Don't let him set foot back here till it's done."

"Copy that."

"Franklin Vance is still trying to bid on our Midtown project?"

"Yes."

"Blacklist him. And tip off a tax auditor while you're at it."

"Understood."

"Wake Geoffrey. Tell him to pack a change of clothes and my shaving kit. Get Gino to deliver them to St Jude's Metropolitan, Director's Wing."

"Right away."

Ashton paused, recollecting. "There's a girl. Freya Laurent. Find out if her parents are on our payroll. If they are, get HR to review their files. I want them to have a promotion. And bonuses. Make it generous."

Freya's video had exposed Isobel. Without it, things would have taken longer.

He would have promoted Freya herself, but she was six. Not quite hireable yet.

Ashton ended the call.

Wind howled through the open windows. He stayed put, eyes fixed on the city beyond the glass, cold air whipping through his hair, over his chest, slicing into him down to the bone.

Didn't help.

His body still burned.

He pulled a cigarette from the pack, turned it over in his fingers, and held it up.
His gaze flicked back to the closed door behind which Mifabelle slept.

Ashton shoved the lighter back in his pocket. Hé lifted the cigarette to his nose and inhaled. Tobacco. Stale sweetness. The sting bit at the back of his throat.

His chest stopped burning.

He stood there until the pressure in his groin finally subsided. Until the sweat cooled. Unti he could be in the same room with her again without risking anything.

Then he turned and went back in.

She was still asleep-barely. The blanket had twisted around her legs, one foot dangling out from the mess.Her breathing was uneven, shallow, chest rising in fits.

He knelt beside the bed and touched her forehead.

She leaned into his palm before her eyes even opened, her voice muffled in the pillow. "Come here."

He climbed in beside her andpulled her against his chest.

She shifted instinctively, nose nestling against his collarbone.

She was in a paper-thin hospital gown. He was still shirtless.

He had thought the cold air and the cigarette had fixed the problem. But the moment her nipples brushed against his chest through the fabric, his entire body snapped to attention.

"Fuck," he muttered, cursing himself. Cursing his usually faultless restraint.

Oblivious, Mirabelle burrowed closer, soft breasts pressed fully against his bare skin.

This time, it was his turn to squirm."Mira..."

She let out a drowsy whine when he tried to shift away.

He rotated his lower half in the opposite direction, hips awkwardly angled away from her, while his arms remained locked around her shoulders.

He was twisting himself into a human pretzel. But he wasn't letting go.

Five minutes passed.
Then she started wriggling again. Her brow scrunched. "Too hot."

She rolled away.

Ashton got up and escaped into the en suite. The shower blasted cold. Ten minutes under the icy spray cooled his skin, but not enough.

Because the second .he returned to bed, she rolled right into him again.

He exhaled slowly, grabbed his phone from the nightstand, and typed out a message.

[Tell Geoffrey to pack several more changes of clothes. And underwear.]
###Chapter 97 Ashton's POV: Hot, Cold, Hot


I woke up with my face pressed against something warm and solid.

It took a second to realize it was skin.

Male skin. Tanned, smooth, slightly salty. Rising and falling in a steady, hypnotic rhythm.

My fingers were digging into someone's abs.

And not soft ones.

The room was dim-early gray morning kind of dim-but not so dim that I missed the fact that I was clinging to Ashton like a koala, and he was bare-chested.

I blinked hard. Stayed still for one moment, then another, waiting for my sluggish brain to boot up.

Last night was a blur. I remembered the fever, the IV drip, the ice packs. Ashton getting into bed with me.Then leaving.

Apparently more than once.

Beyond that? Blank.

My hospital gown was still on, but thin enough that | could feel the heat radiating off him.

And my hand-God-was still resting on his stomach.

I yanked it back, Stopped halfway.

Peeked at his face. His eyes were closed.

Slowly, sneakily, like a thief, I laid my hand back down.

The feel of him was ridiculous.

I'd taken boxing classes, tried to build up some muscle, managed a flat stomach on a good day-but never a six-pack. Let alone an eight-pack.

He had eight.
A perfect eight-pack.

So defined it looked carved. Clinical, almost. Like it should be in an anatomy textbook.

I ran my fingertips lightly over the ridges, tracing the grooves between them. Noting the difference in muscle distribution, not just the surface tone.

Rhys had abs, too, the result of his dedicated gym routine.

But it wasn't the same.

I didn't have a bodybuilder's vocabulary to name the difference. I just knew Ashton's muscles weren't limited to his midsection. His chest was just as firmn, and judging by how his thigh felt under mine, the rest of him matched.

Rhys's abs were probably the only solid part of him. His hands were smooth and soft. His skin, pampered.

I glanced at Ashton again. Still out.

Emboldened, I pressed my palm flat against his stomach. Felt the rise and fall of his breath. The tension stayed, even in sleep.

Shouldn't muscles relax in sleep?

He felt...ready. Like he could go from deep sleep to ready-for-battle in a blink. Like a jaguar.

"Morning."

My hand jerked back."M-morning."

I suddenly became very aware that my thigh was still hooked over his. I shifted to roll away.

And that's when I felt the problem.

The big, unmistakable problem.

I cleared my throat. "Did you...stay with me all night?"

"You don't remember?" His voice rumbled overhead.

There was something different about him. A lightness in his voice.
He was in a good mood.

"I was kind of out of it. Probably delirious."

He touched my forehead, then drew back. "Fever's gone."

"Yeah.I feel better."

He glanced down at me. "Then why's your face still red?"

I froze mid-leg-unhook.

"I'll get the doctor," he said, laughter in his voice as he gently untangled our limbs, got out of bed, grabbed a shirt from the laundry bag on the rack, and stepped out.

I sat up. My body felt heavy, but no longer feverish.

I patted my cheeks. Still hot.

Padding into the bathroom, I splashed cold water on my face and leaned over the sink.

Then I looked up.

And saw the problem.

No bra.

Two very obvious points were poking at the thin fabric of the gown.

"Damn it."

He must've seen. No way he didn't.

"Damn it," I muttered again andrushed back to bed, yanking the blanket up to my chin.

The doctor came in, checked my vitals, and told me I needed to stay a few days for observation.

Ashton had breakfast brought up while I was still fiddling with the blanket. He raised the tray table and started setting up as if it was Sunday brunch at a boutique hotel.

I would've insisted on eating at the coffee table like a normal human with four working limbs, but I kept quiet.
No way was 1 letting the girls be noticed.

Whoever delivered the breakfast must've thought Ashton was catering for a football team.

Toast. Pastries. Scrambled eggs. Fresh fruit. Fourmini jars of jam. Butter. Coffee. Juice. A tall bottle of water that didn't even fit on the tray.

Then he cleared the side table and added cheese. Cold cuts. Smoked salmon. Plain yogurt in a glass jar.

"I'm not a whale, you know," I said, squinting at him.

"The doctor said you might not have much of an appetite. So I asked for variety. Just eat what you want."

"Join me," I invited.

He nodded and started to sit on the edge of the bed, then paused.

"What's wrong?"

"Nothing." He pulled up a chair instead.

I picked up a spoon and got to it.

By the time he'd unscrewed the jam lid, I'd already demolished a cup of yogurt and half a sliceof French toast.


He watched me for a full minute.

"What?" | asked, self-conscious.

"You eat fast," he said calmly, like an observation in a chart. "And you swallow fast."

"Proof that my appetite's fine."

"Eating too fast isn't good for digestion."

I muttered, "Right. Got it."

I tried slowing down. Lasted maybe three bites before I gave up and let my mouth do its thing.

He didn't mention it again. Just looked at me like he was filing it away for later.

The more food I had in my stomach, the more of last night came back to me.
I remembered talking. Saying too much.

Stuff I'd only ever told Yvaine. Things I'd buried years ago. Things I didn't want Ashton-or anyone-to know.

I trusted him; he'd been the ideal fake husband. A perfect partner in crime.

But I hadn't meant to show him the broken bits of the high school version of me.

I hoped he'd forgotten.

Apparently not.

"Isobel Brooke's been arrested," he said.
 ###Chapter 98 Ab Study


"Arrested?" The juice in my mouth suddenly tasted sweeter. "For what?"

"Aggravated assault."

"On?"

"You."

I touched my own nose."But I wasn't assaulted."

"She pushed you into a pool."

"True,"|admitted. "But I'm fine now. NNo 'serious bodily injury.'"

"Not for lack of trying on her part," Ashton said, his voice flat.

"I bet her family's already posted bail." The Brookes had more than enough money for that

"Not this time."

"Why not? Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled she's finally been arrested, but it's just my word against hers."

"There's evidence. Someone filmed it."

I perked up. "Really? Who? I need to send them flowers."

His lips curved. "I already took care of that."

"Thanks." I took another long sip of juice, savoring it."She used to mess with me in school. Barely back in town and already pulling the same crap. I'm not letting it slide this time."

Ashton asked, "What did she do to you?"

"Didn't I already tell you? In the car?"

"Bits and pieces. You were mostly incoherent."

I sipped the juice, set it down, tasted the coffee, then abandoned that too. Picked up the buttered toast and chewed in silence.

He didn't push.

I sighed and lowered the toast. He already knew half of it. Might as well give him the rest. Sort of.

I gave him a trimmed-down version. Just the surface. Skipped the worst parts.

Spilling everything while feverish and half-dead was one thing. Doing it stone-cold sober with full brain function was harder. Even with him.

If Ashton noticed my dodge, he didn't call me out on it.

"What do you want to do?" he asked.

" want to sue her. Properly. If the prosecutor drops the criminal charges"-I rolled my eyes-"because the Brookes will be working overtime pulling strings like last time, then I'm bringing a civil suit. And not just for this. For everything back in high school too. The police kept records. Finn, my lawyer, said he can get them."

"You've thought this through."

"|have."

It was an idea l'd been toying with ever since Serenna told me Isobel was back in town. Isobel Brooke was a rot l intended to cut out for good.

"You've got the entire LGH legal department at your disposal," Ashton said.

I opened my mouth to object.

He beat me to it. "They're already working with your lawyer on the libel suit. May as well keep the teamwork going."

I paused, then nodded. "Thanks."

He didn't look thrilled. "You don't have to thank me. You're my wife. My lawyers are your lawyers."

I joked, "Tell that to couples in the middle of a divorce."

Silence.

He didn't crack a smile. Didn't so much as twitch a corner of his mouth.
I winced and took refuge in my coffee.

After a moment, he said, "You've got me. If you ever need anything, you come to me."

1 nodded."I know."

"I don't think you do."

I looked up. His voice had gone sharp.

"You were gearing up to sue Rhys on your own. Planning to handle Isobel by yourself. When there was trouble at work, you dealt with it alone."

There was quiet heat behind his words. Accusation,tightly leashed.

"How did you-" I broke off. "Of course you knew. Hence that dinner with Octavia Grey. Who told you?"

He ignored the question. "You ever need anything, you come to me." This time, it was a command, not a suggestion. "As long as you're Mrs. Laurent, anything that touches you, touches me."

"Aye aye, Captain." His tone was so dead serious I nearly stood and saluted.

Halfway through breakfast, his phone went off. Twice. Long calls. One of them in French. I nibbled a croissant and watched the butter melt into a golden pool on the porcelain plate.

When he came back in, I said, "You don't have to babysit me. I'm not dying. Or ninety. If you're that worried,get me a nurse."

He shook his head. "I'll work from here."

I could've argued, but I knew a lost cause when I saw one.

The Director's Wing was more suite than hospital roomn. It had a private lounge, a kitchen, and a dining nook.More than enough space to live in.

Ashton had Dominic bring up everything-laptops, files, chargers, two phones, and something that looked suspiciously like a compact espresso machine.

He set up shop in the lounge.

I lay in bed, bored out of my skull.
For an hour, I scrolled through short videos until they all blurred into one long, idiotic loop. My thumb ached,my eyes went dry. I dropped the phone.

There were a few laundry bags on a rack near the bed. Some held his things, some mine.

I pulled out a set of clothes, including underwear, silently praying it was Carmen the female housekeeper who packed them and not Geoffrey.

In the bathroom, I slipped on a tank top and shorts underneath so I wouldn't flash anyone through the gown's rear slit.

Ashton was on a video call in the lounge, sharp French coming fast, face drawn tight as he frowned at charts on the screen.

I slipped out while he was mid-sentence, hospital slippers noiseless on the carpeted floor.

I needed air.

I wandered the corridor like a bored inmate out on parole. Most of the doors were closed. There was no one else except an occasional passing nurse who gave me a friendly nod but didn't stop me.

Looking out the window, I decided to venture downstairs. I figured a place like this had to have a garden somewhere.

I didn't get far.

Two floors down, I stopped.

Something had caught my eye.

Or rather, someone.
###Chapter 99 (Almost) Full Disclosure


Rhys Granger was walking ahead of me, head down, flipping through a stack of papers with the hospital's logo on them.

He had his back to me, but I'd have recognized that lanky frame and those slightly hunched shoulders anywhere.

Right next to him was Catherine.

She sounded chipper. "I told you. It's positive, right? I'm definitely pregnant! The doctor confirmed it."

I glanced at the signpost near the stairwell door. This was the obstetrics and gynecology floor.

My feet carried me forward before I'd even decided to follow; I could smell drama.

The hallway wasn't crowded, but it was busy enough that I could blend in, trailing after them without being noticed.

Catherine sounded thrilled. Rhys did not.

He kept turning the pages as if he either didn't understand the medical jargon or just didn't want to."How the hell did this happen? | used protection every time!"

A few heads turned at that-most people on this floor were all happy tears and heartbeat scans. Rhys was clearly not on-brand.

Catherine noticed, too. Her voice slipped into a pout. "Nothing's one hundred percent. They say condoms only work, like, ninety percent of the time."

Rhys folded the test results and shoved them into his coat pocket. "Doc said your bleeding and cramping are concerning.Suggested a threatened miscarriage."

It was hard to tell whether he sounded irritated or relieved.

"He recommends admission for monitoring."

Catherine protested, "I don't want to stay in the hospital. I already gave up the trip to France. I don't want to be cooped up in a sickroom for months."
"Then you want to risk losing the baby?" Rhys snapped.

That shut her up.

They kept walking.

By this point, I'd forgotten all about the garden. This was far better entertainment.

"Wil you stay with me?" Catherine asked, her voice smaller now.

"1 visit when I can."

"But I'll be lonely."

"I'll hire a nurse."

"Fine."

She clearly wasn't fine. Her voice dipped at the end as if hoping he'd change his mind and offer to stay.

He didn't.

Rhys slowed."Cathy."

"Hmm?"

"Are you sure you want to keep the baby?"

Her voice went sharp. "What do you mean, 'if I want to keep the baby'? Of course I do! l-"

"Lower your voice," Rhys hissed.

Catherine wasn't backing down. "Doctor said if I get an abortion now, it'll make it harder for me to have children later. Is that what you want?"

Rhys stopped, ran a hand through his hair, and let out a loud exhale."NO."

"Then we're keeping the baby. End of discussion."

"I just..."

She took his arm and yanked him over to the admission desk, where she beamed at the nurse. "Hi, we'd like to check in."
She fished the test results out of his coat and handed them over. "I'd like a private room-single, preferably en suite. And TV. Wi-Fi. I hear some of your rooms offer a minibar?"

The nurse smiled. "Of course, miss. Our Director's Wing includes all that, plus premium bedding, daily housekeeping, a la carte room service, aromatherapy options, and personal concierge access."

Catherine turned to Rhys, eyes gleaming. "Rhys! I want the Director's Wing."

Rhys glanced at the price list. "No."

"But I've never stayed in one!"

"You're pregnant, not dying. You don't need that level of care."

"You think I don't deserve that level of care?"

"That's not what I meant," Rhys muttered, rubbing his temple. "I'm just saying it's not necessary."

"| think it is."

Rhys scowled. "The tickets to France, the cruises, the hotel bookings-none of it was refundable.I've already lost close to eighty grand because you didn't want to go, and now-"

"I didn't say I didn't want to go! I was bleeding and cramping-how could I go?"

Her voice turned soft and wounded. "I'd have thought you'd understand. Are you blaming me?"

Even from where I was standing-hiding behind a giant potted fern-l could hear Rhys's.exhausted sigh. He pinched the bridge of his nose. "No, I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying-"

Catherine slid her arm further through his. "The doctor said I need rest and quiet. I'm only thinking about the baby. Your baby. Doesn't that matter to you?"

"Of course it does," he mumbled. "But I'm not sure staying here is such a good idea. My parents use this hospital.Maybe we should go somewhere else. What if we run into-?"

He started scanning the corridor.

And that's when he saw me.

His eyes bulged like he'd just spotted a ghost.
"Busted," I muttered, stepping out from behind the fern like I had every right to be there.

He looked at Catherine, who was still chatting to the nurse about the rooms, then back at me, then at her again.

He froze. Shoulders stiffened, mouth slightly ajar,tie suddenly too tight at the neck.

His face drained. He knew I knew.

"Rhys, come on, they're giving us a tour of-" Catherine turned mid-sentence, caught sight of me, and immediately clutched Rhys's arm tighter as if she thought | might snatch him away.

"What are you doing here?"

"What the hell are you doing here?"

They said it in unison.

"Were you spying on us?" Catherine added.

"No,"I said.

"Really? What a weird coincidence." Catherine patted her still-flat stomach as if she was trying to get me to take a photo. "So you just happened to be at the same hospital, on the same floor, on the same day as us,right when we came to confirm the pregnancy?" She enunciated the last word slowly. "Who tipped you off?Mum? No, no way she's still talking to you. Dad? l-"

"Cathy!" Rhys snapped, face darkening. "I thought we agreed not to tell anyone until-"

She shrugged."She already knows, doesn't she? She saw us."

"Congrats," I said flatly. "I wasn't planning to eavesdrop. I just happened to pass by."

Rhys dragged a hand down his face, then yanked at his tie as if it had shrunk two sizes. "You shouldn't eavesdrop like that."

"I just told you I wasn't. And this is a public corridor. If you wanted it kept secret, maybe don't broadcast your conversation at full volume. Just a thought."

The nurse at the desk snickered.

Rhys opened his mouth for a comeback, found nothing, then blinked at me like he'd only just noticed my osure

outfit.


"Wait-you're a patient? What for?"
###Chapter 100 Pregnant


"None of your business," I said, already turning away now that the show was over.

Rhys barked, "Stop! I'm not done talking to you."

"But I am."

"Don't you have something to say?"

"Like what?"

Rhys was scrutinizing my face as if he were searching for a crack in the wall. "Cathy's pregnant."

I pointed at my ear. "I know.I heard.Not deaf."

"We're getting married."

Catherine, who had been busy scowling at me, snapped her head toward him.

Her jaw dropped. Her eyes went wide, suddenly so bright they outshone the lights overhead.

"Good for you," I said. "Guess that means wedding bells. Do us both a favor and leave me off the guest list."

"Rhys! I-" Catherine beamed. She looked radiant. Maybe it was the pregnancy, maybe it was his love-who could tell.

"Shush." Rhys disentangled her arm from his and stepped up to me. "You don't want to come to our wedding?"

"No."

"Why not? Are you afraid it's going to be awkward?"

"Yeah, I'm afraid there won't be enough seats for all your exes."

"You're not just one of my exes. You're Cathy's sister, which means we'll be family."

It took a heroic effort not to gag.
Did he hear himself? Or was it some kind of honor to brag that he used to sleep with his sister-in-law? Ugh.

"I'm happy for you," I said dryly, though my tone was anything but. "Hope you two go the distance,because once this one tanks, there aren't enough single women left in Skyline City for you to date. Not unless you start recycling."

His brows drew together. The corners of his mouth turned down. He shifted his shoulders as if his jacket had suddenly stiffened into cardboard.

"Is that all?" I glanced at my nonexistent watch. "I've got stuff to do, so..."

"Just a moment."

Catherine's eyes kept ping-ponging between me and Rhys-gloating at me one second, beaming lovingly at him the next. She was like a human traffic light with only two colors.

Rhys looked over my shoulder. "You're here alone?"

I shrugged. "Seems that way. But, once again, none of your business."

If he'd shown half this much interest in me back when we were dating, my heart might have done somersaults.

Now? Nothing.

Catherine chimed in, "That's depressing. No one came with you? You're here all by yourself?"

"What about your husband?" Rhys spat the last word like it had an aftertaste. There was no's' in it, yet he still managed to hiss.

"He's busy." Ruling his business empire from two floors up.

"I see." Rhys's tone lightened, as if pleased. "So that's the kind of man you picked. Can't even bother showing up for a hospital vist."

I let out a short laugh. "As if you ever came with me. Name one time."

That shut him up.

The few times I'd had a fever and called, he'd said I was faking it for attention and hung up.

I learned not to bother after the second time.
Catherine cut in, clearly sensing we were drifting into dangerous nostalgia."Don't you have somewhere to be? We've got a room tour scheduled. Can't stand around all day talking."

Rhys shook off her arm and eyed me again-my outfit, my hands-and something flickered in his expression.A smug glint.

"Mum told me you showed her a wedding certificate. Said it looked legit. But I knew it was fake."

"Oh? Because you're such an expert in document forgery?"

"Because you're not wearing a wedding ring," he announced his big discovery. "If you're really married,and to a man like Ashton Laurent, why didn't he give you a ring?"

He did.

I wore it to Edouard Laurent's party as part of the charade.

But somewhere between falling into the pool, getting dragged out, and the mad dash to the hospital, it must've slipped off.

Mental note: Ask Ashton about it later.

"No clever comeback?" Rhys tilted his chin. "I don't know what you did to rope Ashton in, but it won't hold.Not forever."

Catherine looked more than ready to cut the conversation short. She tugged at Rhys's sleeve again.He ignored her.

"If you've really got Ashton under control, I'll eat my shoes. You two have been married how long,and no one's seen a single photo, no statement, nothing. You ask me, you got lucky pulling that bluff, but it's not going to last. Once whatever hold you have over him wears off, he'll come after you-hard."

"What kind of hold do you imagine I have over him? Nude selfies?" I looked down my nose at Rhys, which was hard to do considering he had the height advantage. "You think he's the type to cave to blackmail?"

"Still, you're supposedly married and he's not even here," Catherine backed up her boyfriend. "You never brought him home. He hasn't even met Mum and Dad. No one knows you two are married."

No one? Try the four hundred guests at Edouard Laurent's house.

I was about to point that out, then stopped.
Why was I even engaging in this argument with the sister I couldn't stand and the ex I'd rather see under a bus?

I shook my head. "Like I said: none of your business. Stay out of my life, and I'II stay out of yours."

"What's the matter? Running off now that we've seen through your lie?" Rhys's grin was obnoxious. Then he softened his voice into something mock-sympathetic. "I get it, Mira. You're trying to save face. You don't have to fake a marriage just because Cathy and I-"

"Save what face?"

"Just because Cathy and I are getting married doesn't mean you need to conjure up some fake husband.It's not a contest."

"Fake? I wasn't aware l'was fake."

We all turned.
