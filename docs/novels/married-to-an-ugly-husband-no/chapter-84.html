                <p>Natalie patted him with her small hands as she called out to him, crying softly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver regained consciousness at this moment, but it took him a while to open his eyes due to the pain and exhaustion. When he finally opened his eyes, he saw Natalie looking at him with teary eyes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The instant Oliver opened his eyes, Natalie smiled, and her tears fell from her eyes onto his lips. He licked his lips. Although it was salty, there was an inexplicable sweetness in his heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Why didn’t you run away? What if those people catch up to us?” Oliver asked weakly.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“What will happen to you if I run away?” Natalie said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was unaware of the impact her reply had on Oliver. His heart softened completely. Despite the calamity, he was overjoyed.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although Oliver was weakened by the gunshot wound and the multiple injuries he sustained when jumping out of the car, he mustered up all his strength and used his still mobile left hand to hold the back of Natalie’s head, pulling her face close to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>To avoid pressing on him, Natalie quickly supported herself with her arms. Before she could react, he had already seized her lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Their kiss this time was much more intense than the one they shared at the parking lot, but it was also much more tender than anything she had experienced before.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie regained her senses, she wanted to push him away but could only dismiss that idea, worried that she would hurt him. In the end, she could only wait for him to end the passionate kiss on his own.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Hey! What’s wrong with you? You’re injured, but you still… Anyway, just stay still!” Natalie said, both annoyed and shy.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing the shy expression on her face, Oliver could not help but smile. After a moment, he asked worriedly, “Are you hurt?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie shook her head. He had protected her well.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Call Isaac or Wyatt,&#34; Oliver said, licking his lips. His face had turned pale to the blood loss.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the distance, the fire from the collision raged on. Before jumping out of the car, he had fired a shot. He was absolutely certain that the person or people in the car had perished in the crash due to the lack of time to escape.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>...</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt arrived quickly and called for an ambulance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Oliver was lifted onto the stretcher, he had already lost consciousness. However, his left hand was holding onto Natalie’s hand tightly, refusing to let go.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>A middle-aged paramedic sighed and shook his head. “Nowadays, it’s rare to see youngsters so devoted to their loved ones…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie felt extremely awkward after they boarded the ambulance. The paramedic had to pry her hand out of Oliver’s grasp to perform emergency procedures on him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie looked at Oliver quietly. Something seemed to have pierced through the fortress she had built around her heart, letting in a ray of light.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>…</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Wyatt and Isaac followed the ambulance in their vehicles.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The surgery lasted a grueling six hours.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was shot in his back near his hip. In addition, he suffered multiple fractures and abrasions. The only part of his body that was unharmed was his left hand.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After the surgery, Oliver was transferred to a VIP ward. The entire floor was reserved for him. He was surrounded by bodyguards, and a few top doctors and nurses were stationed on that floor to attend to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>While Natalie stayed in the ward, waiting for Oliver to regain consciousness, Isaac and Wyatt swiftly investigated the events of the night.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At some point, Oliver, who was lying on the hospital bed, twitched his index finger. His physique was better than ordinary people, so he woke up two hours earlier than the doctors had predicted. However, due to the effects of the anesthesia, he could barely move his body. He scanned the room with his eyes until he found the woman next to him, which calmed his racing heart.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had not slept all night. She had been waiting outside the operating theater earlier and remained by his bed after he was transferred to the ward. She eventually fell asleep when the exhaustion finally took a toll on her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Her head was resting on the side of the bed, and her hair soft hair was spread across the bed, revealing her pert nose, eyelashes, and rosy lips. She was frowning, clearly restless even when she was sleeping.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver recalled the events from last night. He was impressed by how she was able to maintain her composure despite being terrified. She even drove rather skillfully, drifting when they took sharp turns. He really did not expect her to be so resilient. However, what left the strongest impression on him and moved him was her teary eyes and when she asked him, “What will happen to you if I run away?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>No one had cared for him like that in a long time, after all.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His father, Henry, married his mother for power and status, and he continued to have affairs outside of his marriage. In the end, he even brought his illegitimate children back to the Windsor family.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At that time, his mother cried miserably every day. He was only six years old at that time, but his mother had asked him what she should do.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Henry cherished and loved Victoria and Edwin like treasures, but he neglected Oliver and Arthur, not even sparing them a second glance.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Five-year-old Arthur remained cheerful and optimistic, but Oliver was different. At that time, Arthur had asked him, “What should we do? Daddy doesn’t seem to like me.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In fact, Oliver was only seven years old at that time. He was in the same boat as Arthur, and he also did not have the answer to that question.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Intentionally or not, everyone would always ask him this question and ask for solutions. On the contrary, Natalie did not ask him what she should have done. Instead, she only cared about his well-being.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver gradually regained strength, and he reached out to carefully brush the strand of hair resting on Natalie’s cheek away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>It was also at this moment that Natalie woke up. She stared at him blankly for a few seconds before she finally returned to her senses.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;You woke up so quickly?!&#34; Natalie exclaimed in surprise and delight, “Do you feel uncomfortable anyway? Does it hurt a lot? Isaac and Wyatt said they’d come back to see you later.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“It hurts,” Oliver said. It was the first time the prideful Oliver showed admitted to feeling pain. In fact, this kind of pain was nothing to him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Where does it hurt? I&#39;ll call the doctor for you!&#34; Natalie asked worriedly as she carefully looked at his body that was riddled with injuries.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;No need.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Give me a massage.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie frowned. Under normal circumstances, she would think he was teasing her. However, he was pale and injured now, making her unsure if he was teasing her or not. Finally, she shook her head and explained seriously, “I can’t do that. That’ll only aggravate your injuries.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver closed his eyes, hiding the amusement in his eyes. The slight shaking of his shoulders under the blanket was from him holding back his laughter.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Couldn’t she tell I was joking? How could she explain so seriously?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Oliver said, pretending to compromise, “Well, then give me a hug.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie stared at him. She wanted to get angry but could not, considering he was injured.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘How can he joke around when he’s injured like this?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Finally, Natalie pressed the button on the bedside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Soon after, a pretty young woman arrived. She was the attending doctor.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie found the doctor familiar. After thinking about it for a moment, she asked hesitantly, “Aren’t you… the maid from Rosewood Estate?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>She was confused as to how the maid in Rosewood Estate from before suddenly appeared here. Not only that, but the other party now wore a white coat and was examining Oliver, clearly a very skilled professional.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The female doctor smiled slightly and extended her hand as she said, “You have a good memory, Mrs. Windsor. Let me reintroduce myself. I’m Doctor Rosy May. Oliver and I can barely be considered friends…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘No wonder she addressed Oliver by his name earlier… It seems like they’re quite familiar with each other…’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Hello, Doctor May, I&#39;m Natalie,&#34; Natalie said politely. Then, she asked the question that had been burning in her mind, “Then, previously at Rosewood Estate, you…”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Before Rosy could speak, she felt a cold gaze on her. She swallowed back the words, ‘Your husband asked me to pretend to be a maid to treat you’. Instead, she lied, saying, “Oh, I made a bet with Oliver and lost, so I ended up working as a maid for a day.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oh.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie did not suspect anything. She only thought that Oliver had gone too far, making a doctor work for him just because of a bet.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After a thorough examination, Rosy said, “The surgery is very successful, and he’s recovering very well. You can rest assured, Mrs. Windsor.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“But he said he was in pain earlier,” Natalie said, still worried. So many things happened; how could she feel at ease? After all, how painful must it be for someone like Oliver to say it hurt?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Rosy was shocked. After Oliver’s accident at 15, which almost destroyed him, he had never complained about pain. She looked at the man lying on the bed who wore a lazy expression on his face at this moment and thought to herself, ‘How is he in pain?’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Nonetheless, Rosy still said, “Don’t worry, Mrs. Windsor. His physique is truly one of the best I’ve seen in my years of practice.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At the same time, Rosy sighed inward. ‘This adorable little cutie is being deceived by Oliver, the big bad wolf!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Then after giving a few reminders, Rosy left, not wanting to disturb their time together, lest she be killed by someone’s cold gaze. When she was at the door, she suddenly stopped and said, “Oh, by the way, Oliver, you have to restrain yourself from any vigorous activity. Wait until you recover before you do anything strenuous. Don’t do anything that’ll aggravate the injury on the back of your lower hip.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Initially, Natalie listened very attentively, thinking that Rosy had something important to say. However, when she listened to the words, coupled with Rosy’s meaningful expression, her face turned beet red. She did not expect Rosy, who seemed mature and aloof, would also tease them. If Rosy was not a woman, she would have thrown something at Rosy without a second thought.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>After Rosy left, Natalie coughed awkwardly. Thinking that Rosy said Oliver could have some water now, she asked, “Do you want some water?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver nodded.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Natalie walked over, she realized that Oliver could not really move now. How was he going to drink water while lying down?</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“I’ll go and get you a straw.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Do you want everyone to know about my condition?” Oliver asked, displeased.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘I’m not paralyzed. This is just a temporary inconvenience!’</p>
                
                
                
                <p>He had ended up in this state largely because he protected her. If he had not shielded her, he would not have been shot. He also would not have exerted all his strength to jump out of the car and take the brunt of the fall.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Thinking of this, Natalie sighed and asked patiently, &#34;Well, what do you want to do then?&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Feed me,&#34; Oliver said as he stared at Natalie’s lips.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie had little experience with romance, let alone intimate experiences, but she had seen this kind of plot in many TV dramas. She covered her mouth and looked at him in shock, showing her disapproval.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Oliver Windsor, that&#39;s disgusting!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Although he had only ever heard her addressing him by his full name when she was annoyed or angry, he found that it sounded pleasant. He said with rare playfulness, “I don’t think you’re disgusting.”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie blushed and did not know what to say.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>‘Why is this man so shameless?‘</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;If you don&#39;t want to drink, then forget it!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie put the cup aside.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Natalie, you owe me, and you&#39;ll never be able to repay it in this lifetime,&#34; Oliver suddenly said.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>In the past twenty years, Natalie had never owed anyone as much as she owed Oliver. Indeed, she would never be able to repay what she owed him.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Seeing that his pale lips were dry, Natalie eventually compromised. She said, “Why don’t I support your head, and you can have a sip?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Oliver was heavy. Even if she was just supporting his head, she still felt that it was quite strenuous.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Just as she was about to bring the cup to him, his left hand suddenly reached out from under the covers and grabbed the back of her neck, pulling her downward and kissing her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s eyes widened, caught off guard. Her hand shook, causing the water to spill from the cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>At this moment, the door was pushed open.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Oliver, Rosy said you woke up!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>When Isaac and Wyatt saw the scene in the room, they froze, not knowing whether to advance or retreat.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie’s body covered Oliver, looking like she was on top of him, and her hand held an empty cup.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt did not seem to see Oliver’s hand on the back of her neck, and they only thought that Natalie took the initiative to kiss Oliver.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“Uh, sorry, we didn’t see anything! We’ll leave first!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Isaac and Wyatt exchanged a glance before quickly slipping away.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Come back!&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Both of them froze and turned back.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie and Oliver had already separated. Oliver lay on the while Natalie stood at the side blushing, too embarrassed to look at them.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll ask the nurse to change your sheets,&#34; Natalie said, trying to change the topic.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>However, Isaac said teasingly, “Natalie, I didn’t know you’re so assertive!”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie glared at Oliver, telling him with her eyes to explain the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Can&#39;t you say something to explain it?!</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;Alright, stop teasing her,” Oliver said, despite enjoying the show. Then, he said to Natalie, “Why don’t you go and hang out Rosy?”</p>
                
                
                
                <p>His voice was filled with tenderness and indulgence when he spoke to her.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;What about the bed sheets? It’s wet...&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>&#34;I&#39;ll have someone change them.&#34;</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Natalie was eager to leave, so she hurriedly bade farewell to Isaac and Wyatt before leaving the room.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>As soon as the door closed, the atmosphere became tense immediately.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>The playful expression on Isaac’s face also vanished immediately. After a night of investigation, he and Wyatt had also figured out the situation.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>“The person tailing you yesterday was an assassin from the DIE Organization. Two weeks ago, someone put out a hit on you.”</p>
